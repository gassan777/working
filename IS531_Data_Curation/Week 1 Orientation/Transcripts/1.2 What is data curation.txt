Hi everyone and welcome back. This is the second video. What is data curation? We're going to look at definitions of data curation, compare the science with the practice of data curation, look at data analytics values versus data curation values. Talk about the importance of data curation in the data science world we live in today. Also, know finally, the relative size, what I'm calling the relative size of data curation versus data analytics. And I mean, size in terms of investment and also numerical employment. Our definition of data science, one more time. Data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management, analysis, and communication of data focusing in particular on the application of computational methods to digital data. And the data science objective; extracting useful knowledge from data. And yes, I chose these terms very carefully. Creation, management, analysis, and communication. And through studying the definitions and looking at what we're actually doing when we do data curation. You've seen this slide before as well. Data science on this account has two components, curation and analytics. Curation is ensuring that the data can be efficiently reliably found and used and data analytics is employing specific techniques to extract knowledge from data. Now, expanding on that brief characterization of data curation, this is the definition developed here at the University of Illinois at the School of Information Sciences and is widely referred to as the canonical definition of data curation. So, in Wikipedia, I think still today, certainly this spring, and for some number of years, you can find this sentence: According to the University of Illinois, data curation is the active and ongoing management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education. Curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time. That's the definition that we've put out there and that still seems to be accepted as the standard definition. Now, another distinction that we'll make at this point, sometimes useful is between the science of data curation and the practice of data curation. So, the science of data curation, what we're talking about is research and development on new methods of data management and use, typically, drawing on mathematical and engineering methods, but also drawing on equally important methods from social science and also even law, economics, and other disciplines. So, studying data curation and methods of data curation, perhaps, devising new methods. The practice of data creation is the use and yes adaptation of data management methods to meet user needs and support data analytics. So, science and practice, useful distinction, common distinction, not a sharp distinction in the real world, but a real one nonetheless. Reminiscent of Addams Family Values, data science values. So, data analytics values are for instance, information extraction, knowledge extraction should be novel, fast, precise, accurate. Data curation values, data should be efficiently and reliably findable, usable, legal et cetera. And that's how we support novelty, speed, precision, and accuracy. Where real world interdisciplinary challenges and all real world challenges are interdisciplinary. Where they're concerned, curatorial problems really are acute. We're talking about large amounts of rapidly changing data, often heterogeneous in nature from multiple communities. You've got to find it, retrieve it, authenticate it, reformats, so your tools can work with it, integrate it with other data, generally manage it for effective use. And it needs to be demonstrably reliable still even after all this processing and preparation. You need to know what you've done to it and your actions need to be auditable. So, an environment like this, supporting the discovery analysis and use of data is an enormous challenge. It involves the complex management of large scale data storage and preservation, the creation of metadata and tools for retrieval and context documentation, and involves the preparation of computationally assessable documentation for provenance and workflow, otherwise not reliable, not auditable. And you have to be able to conduct reliable format conversions. Again, auditable format conversions to support new tools and new applications. If the results of analysis are going to be trustworthy, all of these interactions, all of the interventions, all of the format conversions, all of the derivations. All the things that you do have to be reliable and that typically means machine readable, auditable. And towards that end, you'll be managing identifiers and validity checks that can accommodate format changes, in other words, you need to know that a format change has occurred. That's easy. But you also need to know that the data hasn't changed. That's hard. That's not a checksum. And, perhaps, most challenging of all, we need to integrate related data elements from substantially different data sources. Or was a headache or a delay, depending on your personality. In a slogan, without successful data curation, successful data analysis is not possible. Analysis depends on creation, it's not really useful without curation. Without curation, it is prohibitively expensive and dangerously unreliable. You may also be interested to know that data curation is actually in a couple of senses, that the larger part of data science, not all was foregrounded in the newspapers and magazines but nevertheless, the larger part in at least a couple senses. For one thing, most of the cost associated with using data is in data curation, not analysis. That's where the money is being spent. Cleaning the data, understanding the data, converting it from one format to another, adding metadata so we can find it and use it more effectively, integrating it and so on and so forth. All of those things. So, that's where the money is. And two, is also where the people are. Most of the workforce needs are also by far, in curation, not analysis. I mean, data sciences is exploding their jobs and roles throughout, but the management of data, the curation of data for analysis is consuming more person hours than analysis. You could ask any data manager in industry and they'll tell you its curatorial work where they make the largest investment of money, staff, time, effort. So, you're interested in nice work and data science, this is a good place to look. And that's all for this video. See you soon.
