Hi everyone. Welcome to Foundations of Data Curation. This is the first week. It's the first class. It's an introduction, no surprise there. It's an introduction to data curation. What it is, no surprise there either I suspect. Let's get started. This is what we're going to be talking about today in the first video, definitions of data science, our definition of data science, the importance of data science, who are data scientists? A really nice ambiguity: science with data or science of data, research versus practice and then finally, a formula, data science equals data curation plus data analytics. What is data science? Why ask what is data science in a course on data curation? Because data curation is part of data science. So here are some definitions of data science starting with Jeffrey Stanton's. It's from a book called "Introduction to Data Science ". Work concerned with the collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, management and preservation of large collections of information. And he goes on to gloss that like this, data scientists play active roles in four related areas: data architecture, data acquisition, data analysis and data archiving. Data sciences is an applied activity and data scientists serve the needs and solve the problems of data users. Another definition. This one from StatS NSF, the science of planning for acquisition, management, analysis of, inference and discovery from data. Not a very graceful definition but it inspires the one that I'm going to recommend in a minute. First, other terms you may know that are clearly related to science informatics, data mining, knowledge discovery, eScience, cyberinfrastructure, data analytics, data curation and so on. Of course, the colloquial phrase Big Data, popular in newspapers and magazines also clearly has something to do with data science. All of these terms in casual use mean different things but often are narrower, broader or overlapping in meaning with what we mean by data science. Now to bring a little order to this confusion here it is, drumroll. Our definition of data is science. Data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management analysis and communication of data focusing particularly on the application of computational methods to digital data. Once more, data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management, analysis and communication of data focusing particularly on the application of computational methods, the application of computational methods to digital data. This is a definition that's intended to be kind of broad, useful, we're not picking any fights with anyone here. We're trying to be inclusive. Big tent, big tent definition. The data science objective, extracting useful knowledge from data. That's what it's all about. Getting useful knowledge out of data. A little bit about the importance of data science today probably don't need to tell you these things. If you were, less you've been sound asleep for the last 50 years you know this and you're in a data science program, so many of you anyway. So you're already convinced nevertheless, I am going to preach to the choir. There are and I think it's interesting to sort of parse these things out and look at them clearly and individually. These are the things that together have combined to create this revolution. One, vast quantities of digital data from a wide variety of sources often arriving in real time. Two, stunning advances in new analytical strategies and computational methods. Three, easy to use powerful analysis tools. Are those libraries awesome? Four, high speed global communications. I hope you have the Internet. Five, access to distributed high performance computing from almost anywhere in the world. Not just communicating with anywhere in the world, but being able to use compute cycles including supercomputers from anywhere in the world. And finally, a cadre of highly educated experts in the new strategies for data management and analysis. These are the things that combine, taken together, create the exciting new opportunities for major advances in many industries professions and disciplines. Medicine, health, engineering, defense, safety, agriculture, business, the arts, community services, government services on and on. No discipline, no field, no profession, no avocation, no hobby, no vice probably, apparently is untouched by data science. Okay. The nice ambiguity that I promised and I know you were looking forward to. Existing, I call it the width of ambiguity. Existing definition, definitions of data science reflect an ambiguity in the phrase, data science. Specifically, is data science to be understood as the science of data or is it science with data? So interestingly, Wikipedia in its lead sentence, has gone back and forth on this. 2013 to 2014 Wikipedia defined data science in its lead sentence as, the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. So that's science of data or science of science with data. The next year in the lead sentence they define data science as simply, the extraction of knowledge from data, which of course some would complain is simply science. So the difference here, the literal difference anyway is clear, in one doing data science is doing research on computational methods. So developing new tools and techniques, studying those tools and techniques and studying their applications. In two, the extraction of knowledge from data doing data science is simply using data science methods to do research in other fields: genetics, medicine, engineering, marketing and so on. It's an interesting difference in practical life, practical data science. Life distinction is as you suspect, hard to make sharp, usually not important. Our definition deliberately punts on this. We ignore the issue. Once again that definition is data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management, analysis and communication of data. That phrase is what allows us to get away with worrying about the width of ambiguity. You can resolve that ambiguity yourselves any way you'd like depending upon what part of the profession you're in. Data science, on our count here, is data curation plus data analytics. So we see two components to data science. Data curation, putting it very briefly we'll expand it next time, ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used. Ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used, and really packing a lot into those words efficiently and reliably. We'll expand it, next time. Data analytics is employing specific techniques to extract knowledge from data. So you might say that data curation is concerned primarily with the management of data in order to better support the analysis of data. Data curation is concerned primarily with the management of data in order to better support the analysis of data. And just to make this a little concrete, before we close. It includes among many other things, acquisition, collection, modeling, workflow, provenance, validity of integrity, metadata, preservation, integration, retrieval, reuse policy, standards, identifiers, format conversions, processing levels, reproducibility and so on. A lot more about those things in our next video.
