All right. Everyone's favorite topic, standards. This is the standards week, there are just three videos this week and the first is standards and standards organizations. Second is some standard standards maneuvers, probably seen some of these before. They're good to know. And then we're going to drill down and talk about some of the formalities of compatibility. All right. Standards and standards organizations. So, why standards? Standards landscape, institutions, things like that and standards from a process point of view. Why standards? You probably know why standards. So, very generally, standards promote reliable efficient communication with others now and with ourselves in the future. And who doesn't want that? A little less generally for the little less grandiosity. So, as you know, a great deal of data curation consists of representing information. If standards are used at every level of the abstraction stack, that abstraction stack that constitutes representation, then efficient reliable representation is supported. In addition, much of data creation involves documentation. If metadata standards are used for documentation, then, again, efficient reliable representation is supported. And even more specifically, as I'm sure you know, standards, the user standards will enable you to support not only the better use of current tools and applications but the use of future tools and applications in your shop, integrate with third party applications and tools, and all of this improves efficiency reliability, also downstream, it broadens access to users, now and in the future and honestly, saves you a bucket of cash in production and opens up a lot of strategic opportunities in your business. You want to sell stuff. People have to be able to process stuff you sell. And finally, if you look back at our data curation actions, it will be obvious that standards promote validation obviously, no validation without standards, authentication, preservation, as we've discussed, regulatory compliance and on and on. You can do the rest yourself. So, I'm sure you know the joke. The problem with standards is there are so many of them and it's true. So, NIST, that's the National Institute for Standardization Technology reported, yes, 20 years ago, that there were 93,000 standards, nearly 700 standard-creating organizations, and the US government was the single largest creator and user of standards. We're not going to look at all of them today. We are going to look a bit at some process issues in the development of standards. So, we see the range of approaches that are taken to developing standards. Some standards simply emerge as common practice within a small group or within an organization, and often that's without any intention to create a standard for common use. Some are developed by little larger working groups or committees, perhaps with representation from different companies or different organizations. Some are developed by larger institutions such as the IETF or W3C, sure you're familiar with those, and some of these are not despite what is often thought directly affiliated with any particular government, either of those two very important standards for us are, and in addition, there are also standards that are developed or managed by standards organizations per se, these are organizations that are devoted to standards in general rather than standards in some particular domain, ISO, the AINSI and IETF, I'm just using their acronyms to encourage you to surf them up. Now, many standards are developed by governments, or global agencies that are working on behalf of multiple governments. Always a good idea. And I'll also point out that standards can begin in one place and then migrate to another during their evolution and end up in a third when there are mature and being maintained and in particular, standards often begin in industry groups, but then are adopted by larger standards bodies that are better-positioned to maintain and evolve them, and to ensure transparency and a sense of openness and participation. Some more process issues. This time compliance and political issues such as transparency and access. Not these are all political to some extent. So compliance with the standard may be in fact is typically entirely optional, but it is also sometimes required by governments and other organizations typically in particular circumstances. You might say it is coziral your hypothetical compliance. They don't just say comply, instead the requirement is usually of this sort: if you wish to do X then you must comply with Y. So for instance, if you wish to receive our endorsement, our sticker on your product, if you wish to use our software, if you wish to bid on our RFP, that's an important one, if we wish to use interstate networks in a certain country, or sell commercial aircraft in another country, these may be circumstances that will entail a regulatory obligation to comply with the standard. One of the really fascinating things about standards development to me is that it is remarkably open to broad participation, and you know this not an accident. It's probably not entirely the goodwill of many particular entity, but if a standard is going to have a positive reception, it needs to avoid accusations of partiality. If a standard looks like it was developed by a small group of individuals or companies and is aimed at furthering their interests, obviously that can seriously impede adoption. So, for the most part, you want to participate in a major standards effort. You just have to show up. I'm maybe exaggerating just a bit but it is a little bit like just showing up is enough to get you accepted. Now, if you to have an effect, when you're there you need to be knowledgeable, you need to know the field, and you need to be prepared with an understanding of where that particular standards effort is and what the issues are. It's a lot of work. There's typically a lot of preparation. If you're going to participate effectively in a standards effort, you got to do your homework and you've actually got to have the right background and career that your homework is doable. I recommend it if you have the chance. If your boss lets you be away from work for that long, and also if your boss will let you spend that much money on travel because my experience, the principal obstacle for many of us to participation is time and experience as I said, but also travel expenses because standards are now international, standards meetings take place all over the world fairly frequently and in very expensive locations. But a lot of fun if you can get involved. I've certainly enjoyed all of my participation in standards development. All right. Let me point out just a few important agencies that are making data-related standards. The American National Standard Institute, ISO which you might think stands for International Standards Organization, not exactly but it's a long story. The W3C, extremely important to most of us now, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, I've talked a bit about that in previous videos. So, what I'd like you to do is visit each of these sites, spend at least half an hour exploring the sites and look for standards that are relevant to your work. And the next two videos we'll make some observations that will I think be interesting to bear in mind when you're surfing these sites. So, before you do this, listen to the next two videos.
