Hi, everyone. This is the week on communication, and we've already kind of got a sense of how communication is central to almost every area of data curation. I can say a little bit more about that by way of communication, of introduction, I mean. And I also talk about communication as itself, an independent area of data curation. Scientific communication of data and of the results of data analysis is a fundamental, essential part of science, technology, scholarship. It has effects in two directions, talk a bit about that. And now, we're going to have crisis. More data and more data analysis is a good thing, of course, but the increase in data and data analysis is causing a crisis in scientific communication. I will set that up a little bit but it's mostly the topic of the second video. Remember this list of curatorial activities? If you look through the list, you'll see most of them have a very substantial communication component. Just picking one almost at random here, discoverability. We want users, scientists, researchers, patrons to be able to find the data they need. We need to communicate to them what datasets are about or they won't be able to find the data set that they need. Access, we need to communicate to our users information what format the data is in whether or not they need to pay for a license, where they can find and download a version. If you just look through the list, you'll see for yourself communication is everywhere and communication is also an independent activity identified partway down the list. Remember definition of data science? Well, communication also occurs in the definition. Data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management, analysis, and communication of data. Remember the methods of curatorial action? Once again, all of these have something to do with communication. Read through them and you can see that: analysis involving metadata, reformatting, updating, documentation, obviously, and so on. Now, communication is relevant to many aspects of data curation, but you knew that. We have a particular focus this week. It's a focus on an area of data curation involving communication that has become particularly important and perhaps even urgent. This is scientific and technical communication of data and of data analysis typically through the medium of journal literature, scientific journals, because this is where scientific results are reported, but also, other similar literatures such as technical documentation. Scientific communication is important for one thing because that's how data gets noticed. That's how it has an effect. That's how it gets some influence on the world. If the result of analyzing data are not communicated, there are no practical consequences. There's no point, you might say. So, the role of scientific communication, typically scientific publishing, in making the scientific results of individual researchers and their teams available to the world is critical. So it's a link between the researchers and the research process and the literature or the realm of communication and availability, and it's a link that conducts information and affects in two directions because not only are the scientists and their teams publishing their findings and results, making it available to the larger scientific community, but at the same time, the scientists and their teams or engineers or doctors, lawyers, it doesn't matter, are going to the literature to get information that they need to design their projects, their research agenda, identify hypotheses, rank hypotheses, identify relevant methods and techniques, adapt those methods and techniques, and so on. So, the publishing rectangle here in the picture sort of sits as a link between individual scientists and their teams and the larger scientific community, and it's a link that doesn't just connect these two things but carries effects, influence in two directions, critical to the way scientists works and always has worked actually. So, scientific and technical publishing is important. It's also in crisis, and that's the next video.
