Hi, everyone. Alright, this week we're talking about identification and identifiers. They're just four videos, the first is why is identification important? The second is, what are we identifying? Third is, how do we identify? And the fourth is, a practical example of XML canonicalization. Why is identification important? So short introduction to identification, and I'll be referring to some earlier discussions in the other weeks. So you've seen a version of this slide. It's on identification problems that are prominent in data curation. For instance, in archiving, is this dataset already in the archive, or not? Preservation, was the information preserved in the new file format, or did we lose some of it? Is it all here or not? Is this the same information or not? Security, has this dataset been tampered with? Perhaps maliciously, perhaps just corrupted. Authentication, is this the data we think it is? Reproducibility, does this XML file have the same information as that JSON file? Provenance, were these datasets derived from the same data, or were these datasets derived from different data? Conversions, does the converted file have the same data as the original? And so on. These are examples of notification problems, and identifiers are here to help. I'm an identifier, and I'm here to help. So identifiers, what are they for? It's a classic representation of what identifiers are for, you can see immediately I think the connection with the identification prompts from the previous slide, identifiers. Identifiers help us discover and reuse relevant data sets. They help us know what data set we've found, if the data set we're looking for, and if you can't find relevant data, and be confident that it is relevant data be confident that it's the data, it purports to be, you're not going to use it. And you should know, it's expensive to produce data, and it's a shame, a scandal, when it's not used as widely as it should be. Identifiers help support more generally the management of data sets as you know, we need to do version control, we need to make corrections, we need to reformat, cannot do this reliably, or efficiently, unless we can name the files involved, and be confident that our naming picks out what we think it picks out, we can use the names going forward to refer to the same thing. Identifier support workflow and provenance tracking. I think that's obvious. And transparency and reproducibility. You saw the examples in the previous slide, that suggested the role of identity an identification in scientific credibility. We need to know how you got different results, did you use the same data? And finally, and this is kind of an interesting, I may have not refer to yet, is it better able us to give credit to people who have produced that data. When you have a reliable identifier for a data set, you can connect that with the organizations or the people who expanded a lot of time, effort, money, and so on producing that data. So, drilling down just a bit. An identifier is often a one word answer to questions like, which data set was the input for your analysis? Which data set was the output of your analysis? Is there a data set in the archive that has temperatures by zip code? Which one is it? Is this the JSON version of that XML data set? Which version was corrected and anonymized? Now, you could answer those questions by saying things like, it's this one, I think. Or it's the one on the red USB drive. Or Bill has it, or maybe Daphne has it, and so on. But probably, no debate here. In the long run colloquial answers are not reliable, which can be a terrible thing. And not efficient even when you try to make colloquial answers, even file names for instance, reliable, tremendously expensive. So reliability without systematic framework, never efficient. Okay, I'm just going to adjust you towards using the low cost of a bunch of initiatives involved in developing identifiers for data, and for things related to data. And encourage you to surf from above referring more to these later. I also want to say a few words about the readings. At this point, I'd strongly recommend that you read as soon as possible, the first two readings on this list, they're general orientation. And I'll return to these readings a bit later. And that's all for the first video. It's a short one. I'll see you soon.
