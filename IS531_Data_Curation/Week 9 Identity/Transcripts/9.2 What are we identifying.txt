All right, hi everyone, this is the week
on identification, identity, identifiers. It's the second video, the title of
the video is, What are we Identifying? We're going to be asking what
exactly needs to be identified. Well guess what? Lots of things need to be identified, [LAUGH] maybe everything
needs to be identified. Why? Because without shared identifiers, we cannot reliably communicate
what we are talking about. So we need identifiers for properties,
persons, values, counties, automobiles, nations, proteins,
events, in other words, everything. There are some shared standards
in specialized domains. And there are some good systems for
developing identifiers. So some good news, but
much remains to be done. You may know that identifiers are at
the very heart of the semantic web, your eyes in particular. So here's an example of a statement
in RDF/OWL using Turtle. And here's an example of a statement,
also in RDF/OWL, also in Turtle, but exemplifying
a literal, there it is, Spiderman. If you're thinking is that
an identifier in the RDF semantics, it's referent is actually itself. So it is an identifier,
it identifies the string Spiderman. It does not identify Spiderman,
that's a story. So all of these identifiers or
things that need identification are important
in data curation. We need to have reliable ways
of identifying names, or being the enemy of, or proteins,
or relationships, and so on. Without a reliable identification scheme,
and in particular a computer
accessible identification scheme, obviously, a lot of
missed opportunities and a lot of problems in the long run for
the data curator. Nevertheless, in this video we're not
going to be talking about everything. Even though everything is
important to data curation, we're going to be talking about data sets. [COUGH] Okay, I'm going to reuse a few slides here
to make point, you've seen these. So consider two files with the same data,
but relational tables in one case and
RDF triples in another, Same data, different representations. Now consider two files, same data and
the same RDF triples, but an XML serialization in one case,
I know it's very ugly, and an N3 serialization in the other. Same data, same RDF triples, but different serializations. Now consider two files with the same data,
same RDF triples, same N3 serialization, but an ASCII character encoding in one
case and an EBCDIC encoding in the other. Same data, same triples, same serialization, different codings,
different lower level of codings. Okay, I know you're thinking I got it, because you've taken this up from
a couple directions and a couple videos. But now we're going to make a little
progress on what to do about it. So questions that should be in our head
at this point is how many of these levels are there? How do we name, define, and manage them? How can they be identified which is
why we're reprising this here and re-identified. How can they be identified and
re-identified? Well you know,
because we spent a long week answering these questions with
the basic representational model. Three entity types, propositional content, symbol structure,
patterned matter and energy. Three fundamental relationships, is expressed by,
is encoded by, is inscribed by. And is encoded by is cursive,
symbol structures can't encode symbol structures,
all the way down. And it's using this conceptual model that we finally have the right
lens on understanding how we can see levels of
abstraction related to one another in a coherent way
whenever we're looking at a file that contains data
in a computer system. Okay, so what are we identifying? Well, it's those things I just mentioned, propositions, a set of propositions,
RDF triples, a set of RDF triples, a set of RDF/XML, Encoding, set of unicode character, sequence of unicode characters, and a UTF-8 bit stream. Now, [LAUGH] we don't actually in data
curation rarely concern ourselves with the actual array state. Maybe we should, most of the time we
don't, I'm not going to address that. So these thing, which are all different,
are all things we need to identify. We need to identify them and
distinguish them. So these are different things that
require different identifiers. Most of them are symbol structures,
RDF triples, RDF/XML, unicode, UTF-8,
those are symbol structures. Of course, what we're really
interested in is propositional content. And yeah, it's kind of puzzling,
how do we actually get at that? That's the next video.
