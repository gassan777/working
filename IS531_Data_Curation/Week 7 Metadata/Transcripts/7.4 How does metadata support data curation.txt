Hi everyone. This one's titled
How Does Metadata Support Data Curation? And yes, we're kind of going from the
sublime to the ridiculous or vice versa. After a couple videos of somewhat labored, almost philosophical rumination. We're now going to talk
about getting things done. Let's start by recalling
the objective of data curation. Data curation is concerned with
all aspects of the management of data in order to efficiently and
reliably support the analysis of data, and enable reuse over time
in order to efficiently and reliably support the analysis of data and
enable reuse over time. Recall our areas of curatorial activities. Recall our methods of data
curation analysis, documentations, system design and implementation,
policy, and process. And metadata is in
the documentation area of method. Okay, in the next two slides I'm going to go through the areas
of curatorial activities. And indicate how metadata
supports activities in those areas by the unique kind of
documentation that it provides. Documentation which presumably rigorous,
formal, and accessible to digital processing. So two slides, there they are. [COUGH] Start with collection,
and there are three columns here, the first is the name of the area,
then the description of the area and then the third column indicates how it's
supported by metadata documentation. So, collection which is support for
collecting and acquiring data, is supported by metadata that documents method, method of collection,
method of sampling, stuff like that. Location, time, instruments, instruments
settings, calibration and so on. Organization, supported by
metadata the documents, schemas and schema documentation for
semantics, syntax and coding. Storage, this is curatorial support for
reliable and effective storage, supported by metadata that
documents the authoritative and alternative copies of data sets,
documents physical location, redundancy, compression,
reduction, backups and so on. Preservation. Here I'm just going to
refer you to organization, identification, which is coming,
and storage. Discoverability, that's supported
by metadata that documents the topic of the database,
the coverage, the formats. Because you don't want to retrieve
something you can't read, right? Availability, currency, and so on. Access, so most of access is covered
in organization security but also access is supported by
metadata that documents licensing, ownership, and, of course, location. Workflow, also everything said
in organization applies, but, in addition, workflow is supported
by metadata that documents scripts, processes, transformations, inputs. Identification, as always, everything
said in an organization applies, and in addition, identification is supported
by metadata that documents identifiers, version data, integrity checks, checksums,
things like that, authentication. All that is represented in metadata. Identifiers themselves even are metadata. Integration, here I just refer you
to what's covered in organization, identification, access, discoverability Part II, modification, reformatting, provenance, reproducibility, preservation, these are all supported by metadata. But in ways that have
already been mentioned. So we start to see that some of these
activities really, are based on others, so there's dependency relationships here. Compliance also based on methods
of metadata documentation in organization probably that's work for
discoverbility, but some other things as
well such as certification. Indicating that a particular
dataset has in fact passed some certification requirements
that can be indicated by metadata. Security, again depended on many
of the things we've talked about mentioned earlier, but
also metadata can indicate encryption, and again security related certification. Communication, supported by metadata
in the ways already discussed. And sharing, once again, supported by metadata documenting things we've already discussed, okay. Before leaving, metadata,
not that we can ever leave metadata, a few words about
the kinds of headaches that are involved in using
metadata in the real world work place this comes
from empirical studies. Are carried out, well by the authors listed below in the citation there. They least four categories
of metadata frictions, standardisation, temporal,
data sharing, human support. Standardization frictions typically have
to do with multiple metadata standards, multiple serialization strategies. Metadata standards that are evolving
either because they're unfinished or they're just frequently being revised. If you're going to have comparable
metadata across time In your shop, you're going to have to update your
metadata as the standards change. Or you're going to have to accept the fact that your community is going to in fact be kind of an island of
an unapplied updates. There's a temporal category,
that they call temporal, the category metadata frictions. And this has to do with headaches
around when do you apply the metadata, in the data management life cycle. And you should be applying it along but opportunities to actually intervene and find ways to develop metadata, relatively efficiently without
bringing the process to a halt. This can be a real headache
in the real world. Sharing frictions. So, when the question that inevitably
arises is who is this metadata for? And if it's for highly sophisticated insiders in a community that's one thing, if it's in fact intended to allow others outside your community
to find your datasets, understand them, use them and so on. That requires a different
kind of design and promotion. Most of the time we're
actually doing both and there're conflicts there. And finally, human support. This is cross-cutting actually, it's involved in all of
these friction categories. Unless you're part of
a really large operation, NASA for instance,
there will not be metadata, there will not be anyone
who's job it is to design, promote, train,
manage metadata activities. Instead the managers will be
trying to coerce programmers and engineers, to choose metadata schemas, choose serialization strategies. And then, this is the hardest part,
actually stick with it and do a good job of recording metadata
when it needs to be recorded, and according to the normative policies,
and your shop is actually developed. It's a legitimate question to ask,
what is the ROI on any particular set of
metadata recommendations? And sometimes we do go to far, but more often, I would say,
we don't go far enough. And lack of metadata hugely
diminishes whether or not your data can in fact, be used reliably and efficiently, to support data analytics. And that's it for
the metadata week, see you soon.
