Welcome back. Hi everyone this is the data practices week. And what we're doing this week is taking an empirical view of what people creating, analyzing, and managing data actually do, what they actually do, or would do if their circumstances were changed. And we do this in order to of course improve efficiency and reliability perhaps by developing new tools or new practices and testing those tools practices methods. Four videos this time, one introducing the notion of data practices from an empirical point of view, how do we know what works? That's the question here. How do we know what works scientifically? Second video, what is actually going on in the lab? Of course, we can't. It's not a long survey of all things going in all the labs but just a quick look at the sorts of things that one might look at. If you wanted to know more about what's going on in the lab with respect to data, and of course you might suspect as you probably know, it ain't pretty. Third video is data sharing. Very important and very difficult. We'll take a look at why it's important and most importantly why it's difficult. Data reuse a lot like data sharing, but different and has different problems. We'll take a look at what we know about data reuse from an empirical point of view. So, I'm going to start by talking about the empirical study of data practices in general. The question is how do we know what works? And trying to find out what works, and developing practices, tools, etc, that works. This is the empirical science of data curation. We'll talk about empirical studies, what they are, a couple of kinds, constructed, naturalistic, and data collection, and data analysis in each. Okay, the empirical science of data curation, and this is where I get a little sententious so roll your eyes if you like. The science of data analytics is yes interdisciplinary and yes probably social science, but it's mostly mathematics. The science of data curation is yes interdisciplinary and yes probably mathematics, but mostly empirical social science. And you can see that by taking a look at what you might consider the fundamental question in the science of data curation and at least a central one, how can we more efficiently and reliably support the use of data? How can we more efficiently and reliably support the use data? And this is clearly an empirical question. It's not a question that typically we can solve by proving a theorem or doing other sorts of math. This is a question that requires collecting and analyzing data, and it's data about what people do in the workplace. Drilling down a bit, empirical science of data curation, how do we do it? That is how do we proceed? To answer the question, how can we more efficiently and reliably support the use of data? We got to conduct empirical research, got to collect data about what's actually going on in the workplace or in the lab. And we can roughly divide empirical with research of this kind into two categories: constructed studies, naturalistic studies. So, constructed studies these typically follow the classic scientific model, conjecturing a hypothesis and then constructing an experiment or other targeted data collection or simulation to elicit confirmation of that hypothesis or reputation. And constructed studies are particularly useful in the science of data curation when you're testing a new tool or practice or determining how a particular intervention might affect behavior, or trying to figure out exactly what is influencing behavior. Naturalistic studies, and for the most part these days naturalistic studies dominate the empirical science of data curation, and that's for good reason which I'll mentioned at the end of this slide. So naturalistic studies typically collect data about an ongoing research situation data in a lab, or in a field, or in a work place. So, here we are observing what researchers and their staff are actually doing, and then using that data to develop theories about what they're doing, theories about the research process or about data curation, also to develop ideas for changes and practices. So naturalistic studies may or may not be a hypothesis at the outset. These days that typically is it, they're somewhat exploratory. Naturalistic studies are useful for identifying problems and opportunities, and they're also useful for developing a general picture of what's going on in research and data management practices in a field, institution, lab or workplace. These are still early days in the science of data curation as opposed to just the ad hoc opportunistic art of data curation. So, exploratory studies of the naturalistic kind are very important. And we have at some point we'll be able to do a lot more constructed experimental work but we need a thick rich picture of what's going on first, a lot of learning there. Methods. So you get to collect data, you got analyze it. This is empirical science. So data collection methods and empirical studies of research and data curation processes can include a wide variety of things. So for instance, interviews, surveys, transaction log analysis, looking at the queries over time and who does them, in what order, stuff like that, patterns, work product analysis like code, data, workflow, time and motion studies, experiment simulation, all sorts of things. You notice that the emphasis is on what people do. What they do, what they say. Whether it's volunteered or in response to a question or an interaction of some kind and also indirectly, what they do, what they say, we can learn about that by studying the work products. Studying their code, studying their workflow, studying where they move, what they reach for, what they do. Stuff like that. You can analyze that data and analytical methods in empirical studies of this area include of course mathematics, variety of kinds, but these days particularly statistics but also reasoning about algorithms and data modeling, qualitative and analytical tools of various kinds so that we can take a close look at those interviews and surveys and sometimes called interpretive methods in which kind of humanistic context is brought into the picture. These things are always informed by substantive theories and results in a wide variety of areas but particularly computer science, information science, and psychology and cognitive science. That's video one, introducing the notion of an empirical science of data curation and the research process. See you soon.
