All right. Welcome back, everyone. Hope you're all fine. This is the week on data practices, empirical look at the world data curation. It's video four, data reuse. So we'll take up initially the question as always. What is reuse, and why is it important? Reuse versus sharing, interesting comparison there. What are the principal obstacles to reuse, and how can reuse be supported? And by this time, a lot of our, not just the structure of our perspective on these things but our elaboration of the issues and the remedies as well are going to start to sound somewhat familiar. Okay, what is the question? Data reuse, what is it? And there's a very nice common characterization by Zimmerman. Data reuse is the use of data collected for one purpose, to study a new problem. I'd elaborate on that a bit. I think we can also say that data reuse is the use of data collected by one technical community and being used by another technical community. So this is independent of whether or not those two communities are studying the same problem. These are rough characterizations and, in fact, they both could apply in various ways. So, for instance, you might have different communities. You might have different problems. There might be other differences as well, but what ends up being salient here and problematic is you've got different methods, different practices, different vocabularies, different software, and so on. And that's where the challenges come from. Okay. You might ask, what's the difference between data sharing and data reuse? So, they are closely related, but there is a really nice rough distinction that can be drawn. This distinction is made by focusing on the perspectives, different perspectives taken by research studies in this area. So, research studies on data sharing tend to focus on why and how data producers share or don't share their data, and how we can encourage and support data sharing by focusing on the producers, intervening with the producers. Data reuse studies tend to focus on how communities use or why they don't use relevant data that they did not produce and for which they are not the intended consumer. And, of course, how we can encourage and support the reliable and efficient reuse of such data. So this is more focused on the receiving communities, the communities that are using the data rather than the communities that are producing and sharing it. So it's this different perspective primarily that distinguishes data sharing from data reuse, data sharing focuses on the producer, data reuse on the consumer, I would say the consumer as well as the producers' target intervention. And this is an interesting distinction because the issues tend to be mirror images of each other, as you'll see. As an aside, notice the footnote on the slide here, the very influential OAIS data archiving standard has a special term designated community, which it uses to characterize the intended consumer of produced data. So you're often producing data. You intend certain communities to use it. It might be yourself. It might be your community. It might be another community. The community that's the intended consumer is called designated community by OAIS. Our next question, as always, is, in this case, why is data reuse important? Guess what? Data reuse is important for the same reason that data sharing is important. So this is our data sharing slide with the word sharing simply replaced in the two places where it was used. Data reuse is important because data is important, expensive to produce, valuable to many communities, including those that did not produce it and for which it was not intended. Failure to reuse data means lost opportunities, additional expenses and, in some cases, can have extremely serious consequences. These are easy to imagine. Just think medicine, engineering, hurricanes, tornadoes, and so on. Okay, and if you'd like some empirical data on the consequences of not being able to reuse data, get the slides of empirical data on consequences. Here, we have researchers reporting on the consequences of lack of access to data generated by other researchers. And it's a five-point scale, and you can see it's described as a major impediment to progress in science and has restricted my ability to answer scientific questions, 3.99 and 3.36 respectively. That's pretty impressive. So what are the challenges facing anyone, any community, any organization that would like to use data that was produced by another community and is not intended to be used by the community that wants to use it? So, these are factors that influence reuse. Obviously, you have to discover the existence of the data. This can often be more difficult than you would think. If you do find data that's at least a candidate for being useful, punitively useful, you have to assess whether or not it is genuinely relevant and useful to your project or problem. Then when you actually get your hands on it, so to speak, you may be faced with data format problems. These might be low-level problems, file format serialization. These might be higher level problems, the logical and conceptual modeling issues that we discussed in the past. There may also be semantic problems as well. So there may be an unfamiliar vocabulary in the metadata or in the attributes or in the predicates. There may also be a familiar vocabulary, but you suspect the definitions are different, or you may suspect that the operations that actually generated the data that actually determine whether or not the predicates applied are different. So there may be issues with the operational definitions, what a particular research group or collection protocol counted as falling under a particular concept. So it made the conceptual definitions clear. They may not have the operational definitions share. It may be concerns about trustworthiness, your wonder about the inputs, the algorithms, provenance, workflow, all of those things, and if you're uncertain about them, you'll have access to them. You'll have access to these things in formats and through modalities that allow you to assess them, you'll be uncertain as to whether or not you can trust this data. There are other reasons to be suspicious as well. It may simply be that the providing organization is fundamentally untrustworthy. There may be concerns about intellectual property. Do you really have a right to use this data, under what circumstances, under what conditions? You need to make sure that you're able to give credit. If you use that, there may be regulatory, even statutory issues, involved as well. You'll have to navigate those. So, obviously, these factors, and we could continue with others in this vein, are similar to the data integration issues discussed earlier in this course, and it's not surprising that reuse of data is going to be, in many respects, similar to, with respect to challenges, similar to integrating data with your existing data and tools and methods. Probably, equally obvious, is that on the supply side which we're looking at here, standards and documentation, especially metadata are going to be key to supporting reuse. If the providing communities, the data generating communities are using good data description standards, and symbolization standards, and metadata standards to document their data. You're going to be able to find it easier, assess relevance, understand the serialization file formats, understand the logical conceptual modeling issues, understand what the actual semantics of the vocabularies are, and also the operational protocols as well. You'll be able to assess trustworthiness more likely than not. And also you'll be able to engage with intellectual property and other legal and regulatory issues. So the support of reuse is fundamentally influenced by the adoption of standards and by good practices with respect to documentation. Let's take a look at some challenges to data reuse that are specific to certain areas, certain communities. So in the medical and financial areas, and to a lesser extent, social governmental areas, in general, we have data that is heavily regulated by federal state statutes, as well as common civil law, particularly around issues such as privacy and violation, even if inadvertent can result in severe financial liabilities. So this is a major concern when working with medical data, working with financial information about individuals, working with research data of any kind, about individuals. This is where the federal state local regulations are substantial and the penalties are severe. If you read the newspapers, you already know this. I also pointed out that if you're going to use data of this kind, there may be required security arrangements, special technical security conditions for use and you may not have a shop that has this level of security. And developing a level of security can be expensive. This is also an obstacle to data reuse. So more generally and for profit businesses, you know, many for profit businesses have the challenges just mentioned of course, but they have others as well. So, in many cases data or access to data may itself be the principal revenue generating business product, and that revenue generating strategy simply may not work if the data is public, if it's being reused by competitors or being made available by non-profits, for instance. Data, even if it's not the principal revenue generating business product, can have strategic value or strategic vulnerability to a business unit. And that means negative consequences if it's public. And in interesting cases, negative consequences for the unit, but perhaps greater social value to the larger community, state, nation, world. So these are interesting issues in public affairs, when we have data that's strategically valuable to a business. But if that data are more widely available, everybody would be better off at what do we do. Even if data is available, provenance and workflow, with respect to that data, may be restricted and that limits the value of the data in reuse. You may be reluctant to use data that's available, if you don't have provenance and workflow. You can't assess its trustworthiness. And data circulation also can, in some circumstances, constitute violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. You can easily imagine cooked up examples for this where price fixing takes place by exchanging data. Not saying it's common, but it is a worry for some of us who work in industry-based standards. Efforts that bring together competitors for around the table to work at a standard and presumably around that table, they have the opportunity to change their pricing plans, which would be illegal. And finally of course if you're not careful, you can end up being complicit in a licensing violation, and again, you don't always have to have intent to incur financial damages. And these civil cases, simply failing to be vigilant and sometimes even that's not required. So these two are all challenges to data reuse and we could operate them further, but we won't. This video's over. And let me end this video by repeating that data reuse can be profoundly important to society, in many areas, but making it possible means overcoming obstacles and challenges typically with remedies that involve using standards, improving documentation, especially computationally accessible documentation and metadata. If we can do this, then the data that we're generating can be used more widely and we can bring together data from multiple sources to solve real world problems. Remember, real world problems inherently, interdisciplinary. So if we don't bring together data from multiple sources to address real problems, we're not going to solve them. And whenever we bring together data from multiple sources, we're involved in data reuse. We have a community that's using data that it did not create, and that to a large extent, no one anticipated that community using. And that triggers data reuse challenges.
