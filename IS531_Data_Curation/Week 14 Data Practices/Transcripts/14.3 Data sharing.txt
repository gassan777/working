All right, everyone,
this is data practices week, third video, data sharing. We talk about why data
sharing is important, why it's hard, what the impediments are, and also what the incentives might be, and we might actually have an impact
somehow on propensity to share. So, why is data sharing important? You start with the truisms here,
the banal truisms. The data, of course, important and valuable to communities beyond
the developing community. That is the data that
a community develops, that a lab develops, that a company
develops, that a team develops, is going to be valuable beyond
the developing entity, obviously. And it's arduous and time consuming and
expensive to develop data. So, yeah, since it's arduous,
time-consuming, expensive to develop, let's use it
beyond the community that develops it. In addition,
we often need relevant data immediately. There's sometimes a crisis in
which that data is important. So, failure to share data
means lost opportunity, it can mean additional expense, and it
also can have very serious consequences. They care about data in medicine or
engineering, or data used to respond to a natural
disaster such as a hurricane. So if data sharing is so
important, why is it so hard? So on the receiving side
that is getting the data, we have the usual data
integration difficulties. You gotta find the relevant data, you
gotta make sure you've got permissions and licenses, and then you have to integrate
data, often in different formats and description standards into the receiving
system, tools, applications, etc. And you gotta understand it correctly. So, we've looked at those
problems already and we're going to be revisiting them
again in the next video, data reuse. In this video,
we focus on the sharing side. Not the receiving side,
but the sharing side. The question there is, why share? So here's some data
developed by Carol Tenopir, again, on why researchers
are often reluctant to share data. Specifically, this has to do with
what we might call data misused and broadly construed. So, many researchers
believe that their data may be misinterpreted due to
the complexity of the data. Look at the percentages here. This is 12, actually 1,300 respondents, and 75% of them felt
that if they shared data, it might be misinterpreted due
to complexity of the data. Now obviously,
some additional documentation or the use of standards could theoretically remedy that, but that's a lot of work. And there may be skepticism about whether
in fact it can remedy this problem, namely potential misinterpretation. Data may be used in other
ways than intended. Again, nearly 75%, nearly three quarters. Once you share your data, you don't
know what it's going to be used for. And then [LAUGH], very interestingly, the fear that it may be misinterpreted,
not due to complexity, but due to poor quality,
which may be as much as anything a fear that the poor quality might
not reflect well on the team. And here are some additional data
sharing impediments that have been collected by Carol Tenopir, again,
in the same article, and Melissa Cragin. Let me draw your attention to Chris Bergman's remarks that there are no rewards for sharing data. It was felt by some in the science and
humanities that you could lose competitive advantage,
that you owned the data. These are pretty hard to overcome. And finally, just some more examples
of things that we hear that aren't encouraging. Where's the best place for my data? Clearly, questions like this are going to
be time consuming to answer. If you can't answer them in a reasonable
amount of time, researchers are very busy, it's not going to happen. My data is here,
that's not really a systematic response. Of course, I'm willing to share my data,
but never a good sign. My data will never be
of use to anybody else. There are no standards in my field,
so how could you use it? What version of my data should I share,
raw versus processed? What if it's continuously streaming? And, of course, researchers will need
special analytical tools to reuse this data, so
they probably can't use it, or they're going to be asking me for
those tools and I have other things to do. And one of the very
interesting things about sharing practices is the way that these
impediments are overcome partially and differently in different fields and
disciplines. So you see here that in
different disciplines, astronomy, chemistry, crystallography, genomics, systems biology, classics, so on, there's different
culture of data sharing, different levels of infrastructure,
and different policies in effect, and of course,
different actual sharing degrees. Finally, as earlier,
what incentives, what can we do? Well, we can once again say, just contributes to science,
both globally and locally. Because people are going to come back and
they're going to say, here's what we learned using your data, and then you
can take it from there, and presumably, even better position to go on and
do new science with that input. Credit, as I mentioned earlier, when
you're sharing data, you're going to be getting credit for that data, more credit
than you would ordinarily have gotten, and there'll be more citations to your data
than you would ordinarily have received. So this is something that could be
pointed out to those reluctant to share. Infrastructure, now, this time we're
imagining is that you improve your infrastructure because of what
you learned about your data from other people who you've shared it to and
are using it. So you can improve your application,
interoperable applications, you can improve you reliability and
reproducibility and so on because you have a better,
broader understanding of the data that you produced,
because other researchers or other data users have worked with
that data and developed new insights. Reciprocity, [LAUGH],
if you don't share data with others, don't expect them to share data with you. And finally, again,
if data sharing can be at least partially or
implicitly connected with tenure promotion assessment because
it's part of being a good citizen, this can also [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]
incentive to share, obviously. So there's a lot of research right
now going on around data sharing, because everyone's convinced that if we
could get more data sharing happening, we would all be better off. And yet, it seems hard to get
that sharing to happen and the issues are quite different in
different fields and disciplines. All right. And I'm going to end this video by
saying if you are generating data, think about sharing it, and
maybe somebody will share theirs with you. See you later.
