Welcome back,
this is schema integration, an example. So we're going to do an example that'll
have some moves similar to the ones you've seen. This is a classic bit
of schema integrating. Here we go, and we're using books again,
and we'll use books in the future. Everybody likes books, I hope. So in one model we have relationships,
entity types, attributes that look like this. Books are published by publishers, adopted
by universities, they refer to topics. And this example,
by the way comes from Pattini Adal. It's a good one. Here's an alternative
model of the same domain. It's almost a little debatable
whether when you have two models that are different, whether they're
really modelling the same domain, especially if you take domains that
are in the eyes of the beholders. But anyway, this model, we have
publications of different types and each publication has a list of keywords. So how do we integrate these
two conceptual schemas? We peer at them and notice that Topics and Keyword appear to refer to the same thing. We think about books,
we think about publications and using our domain knowledge conclude
there's a relationship here. A set of all books is a subset of the set
of all publications, proper subset. We also note that publisher is an entity
in one schema, an attribute in another. And we don't need any additional domain knowledge to imagine
a resolution for that. Acting on those observations we use
"Topics" for "Keyword" as well. You can study these slides if
you'd like at your leisure. We make "Publisher" an entity,
here we go, not an attribute. We squash these schemas together, and I encourage you to stare at this for
a while. We create the obvious subset relationship
that we knew we were going for, removing unnecessary relationships and
we're done. This the integrated schema,
no information lost. Nice example, and notice we didn't
have any overlaps really or other peculiar,
challenging integration issues. In fact, in the real world,
it is not that easy. It's a massive headache for everyone,
data integration, schema integration. And if you're involved in data curation
you'll be spending a lot of time doing it. All right, this was a short one but
it is the last video in data integration. And looking forward to
seeing you all next week.
