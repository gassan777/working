Okay, the identity problem. First we're going to talk about identity problems in data curation in general. And then we're going to talk about identity problems and representation levels. Very challenging set of interactions there. So identity problems are throughout data curation. Sometimes it seems like almost every data curation issue, activity, intervention involves identity in some way or other. For instance in archiving you might ask, is this data set already in the archive? Question there should be an answer to. Preservation. One might ask was the information preserved in this new file format? Is it the same information that we had in the old file format? In other words, security. Has this data set been tampered with? Authentication. Is this the data we think it is? Reproducibility. Does this XML file have the same information as that JSON file? Provenance. Were these data sets derived from the same data? Conversions. Does this converted file have the same data as the original? And so on. Summarizing sort of a number of these problems are marked by Ruth Duerr from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder. There are an unknown number of transformations that are invariant in the sense of preserving scientific meaning. Meaning she means of course that we will transform one data set into another. For some reason or other but intend that the transformation is invariant with respect to scientific meaning or as I would say same data. But as she says, different scientific communities use different tools, they require different representations. This is routine in our data curatorial lives. Routine whether it's to support using different tools, whether it's to ensure preservation, whether it's to check on reproducibility authentication and so on. Underneath all these different activities, the identity issue has a kind of fundamental uniformity in every case. Let's look at conversions a little closer. So conversions, say set take place constantly for many many reasons and all kinds of conversions, some conversions will be very simple format changes. Who knows maybe just the line ends, tabs to spaces. Others will involve a change in model type, might be challenging might not be. Some do have scheme integration challenges, might be structural, not too hard. Some of course will have profound heterogeneity problems. When any of these conversions for whatever reason takes place, if it's successful, we typically say the data is the same. It is only in a different format, a different encoding et cetera. Now sometimes of course we derive new data from input data. That's different and we'll discuss that later in workflow and provenance. Right now we're considering cases where we're not deriving new information from our data or rather transforming one data set into another without changing as Ruth Duerr says, the scientific meaning derivation almost by definition is a change in scientific meaning. So in a successful conversion, something changes and something remains the same but what changes and what remains the same. That's the question. Okay let me pick up a different thread here and I'll weave them together eventually. We might say in a certain circumstance, two biologists, Jill and John use the same data. This is actually a very important observation. Whether or not two biologists use the same data is often extremely important in understanding scientific results. But what does it mean to say that they use the same data and how can we tell that they used the same data. No, it can't just be a checksum. So that's a spoiler. Suppose however we say two biologists Jill and John use the same statistician? Now that's not puzzling. We know exactly what it means to use the same statistician. Statistician identity conditions are well known and easy to use to identify and re-identify the people who are statisticians. It's not the case with same data. To see that it's not, consider two files with the same data, but in one case relational tables and in another case, RDF triples. Same data, different representations. Okay. Now consider two files with the same data and the same RDF triples. So a lot's the same. But an XML serialization of those RDF triples in one case and an N3 serialization of those triples in another. Same data, same triples, different serialization. Two files, same data, same RDF triples, same N3 serialization but in one case an ASCII character encoding, in the other an EBCDIC character encoding. We might wonder, how many levels are there possibly. Is there some fixed number of encoding levels here? Or is it indefinite. How do we name them? How do we define them? How do we manage them? Big problems data curation. How can they be identified and re-identified? And by the way you see why checksum won't work to identify data. So underlying many maybe all data curation issues is the problem of identity. Is X the same data document text image whatever as Y. They're really two separate questions here. Meta expressions you might say. About the question is X the same data document text image whatever as Y. Those two are the conceptual question. What do we mean by same, what do we mean by same data, same document, same image. And then how do we tell what kind of tool algorithm policy would help us actually and preferably in a mechanical step by step way, an operational way, make the identification. And this introduces identity conditions as the inspiration for the next steps which we take in the next video.
