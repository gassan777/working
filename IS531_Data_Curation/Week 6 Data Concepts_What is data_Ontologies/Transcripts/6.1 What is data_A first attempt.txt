Hi everyone. This is the Data Concepts week
of Foundations of Data Curation. The first video asks the question,
what is data? It's our first attempt
to ask that question. You might think, gee, shouldn't we have [LAUGH] asked
that right away at the beginning? Actually, no. We've discovered that both with respect
to the question what is data and related questions with respect
to fundamental data concepts, they're pretty abstract, and it's a good
idea to build up some momentum and some acquaintance with
the problems of data curation before turning to these more
abstract questions and answers. And that practical orientation will
also give us a little more insight into why these issues are important. Okay. What is data? The first attempt. We're going to look at some
dictionary definitions. We'll see they're useful but not formal
enough, and they conceal problems. We then look at a more empirical
approach to this question. It yields additional insights, but again, no rigor, lots of variation,
and even inconsistencies. Scientists, particularly those involved in
curation, will insist that we're not done. Formal definitions are needed, conceptual
models are needed, so we're here to serve. We aren't going to give up. Our question is, what is data? And what we want to know is what is data,
not who is Data. Commander Data there. What kind of answer do we want? What we're after is a formal
definition of data, one that is part of a conceptual model,
or ontology, of data concepts. This is not just a theoretical interest,
as you'll see. A conceptual model for
data concepts, if we had one, would provide a rigorous
formal foundation for the design of systems supporting
all aspects of data curation. What's going on right now,
you might wonder? Well, everybody has a slightly
different model in their head. We really haven't gotten to
the point where there's a lot of shared agreement on what
a good conceptual model for data concepts would be,
let alone articulated one formally. Let's look at some definitions. These are from dictionaries, most of them. So, at the top, information. These are definitions of data. Information, especially information
organized for analysis, from the AHD. Factual information,
such as measurements and statistics, used as a basis for reasoning, discussion
or calculation, Merriam Webster. A collection of facts from
which conclusions may be drawn. That's from the Princeton WordNet Project. Very interesting project, surf it up. A collection of observations,
is very, many, many definitions of data start this way. I haven't actually been
able to find the origin. And a collection of organized information,
usually the result of experience, observation, or experiment. May consist of numbers, words, or images, particularly as measurements or
observations. So, are we done? [LAUGH] We looked up data in
the dictionary, well, we aren't. These are much too casual for
rigorous modelling. What we want is a conceptual model,
or ontology, for data concepts, not casual dictionary
definitions that do a fair job of indicating how a term is typically used but does so
in a way that allows far more variation than we could
accommodate in a formal model. And at the same time,
it does not attempt to go after the essential fundamental
features of a concept like data. So how about an empirical approach? Okay, if looking it up in
the dictionary is not going to work, let's do a systematic
content analysis of how scientists define data in their articles, because scientists should have
an answer to this question, right? They don't, but let's pretend. Okay, so, here at the School
of Information Sciences, we did a study taking a look
at how scientists define dataset in their scientific papers and
related to no documentation. And results are pretty interesting. Turns out that there is a fairly
common set of four areas, content, grouping, purpose, relatedness, that occur in most definitions of dataset,
which is pretty encouraging. And if you look at the next slide,
you'll see that those areas match our dictionary
definitions fairly well. The legend is colored there so
you can see references to content, references to grouping,
relatedness, purpose. But at the same time,
if you look at what's included in these areas are what terms
are used to characterize the area. There's a tremendous amount of variation,
and the variation clearly cuts
across ontological boundaries. So a file, a measurement, a fact, RDF triple, observation,
those are all from content. Clearly those are radically
different kinds of things. And all of the lists here
associated with each area, you can see, are fairly diverse. So is there enough agreement
here to support modeling? Not really. There is too much variation, and
the kind of variation is just too extreme. Purpose, relatedness, and grouping, as common as those areas are when
you look at them closely, but the sorts of things they cover
vary too much from paper to paper. Especially challenging is
the variation within content. Observations, values,
facts, numbers, records, expressions, triples, tuples,
information, all kinds of things. All things of radically different kinds. So while we do see patterns,
colloquial definitions, even by scientists, well, maybe shouldn't
call them colloquial, no disrespect, but they're still,
from a modelling point of view, too informal, too varied, and
actually too inconsistent. So things don't look too
good at this point for proceeding to develop a formal
model based upon empirical observations of how data and
dataset are defined. So we might hope that maybe scientists
just don't care about definitions, and we can just bail on this whole project. Right. Not likely? Actually, scientists do care. Here are just a couple examples. Can find others in the literature. Sam Pepler, National Center for
Atmospheric Science in the UK says, there's an ambiguity in what
type of object a dataset is, with different groups of users
applying different connotations. There needs to be an explicit statement
of what the intended preservation of a dataset will imply. He's a little frustrated. And Bruce Barkstrom at NASA,
while there's been substantial work in the IT community regarding metadata and
file identifier schemas, there appears to be relatively little work on
the organization of the file collections. One symptom appearing in
nomenclature describing collections, the terms data product, data set, version, are overlaid with multiple
meanings between communities. And, in both cases,
the problems that result are described. So there is a sense that although
it may be difficult to develop a conceptual model for data concepts,
it would be beneficial to data curation and
the use of data if we could do that. So, the next step in that
direction is in the next video.
