Hi, everyone, welcome back,
this is What Is Data? Yeah, you might think, shouldn't we
have started with that question? As I said earlier,
the answer's actually no. It's an abstract question,
not a good idea to start with. As I've convinced you, now is the time to dig into these intricate, somewhat
abstract, but very important issues. So we are now positioned to answer
the question, what is data? I'm going to give an answer based
on the ontology we just developed. And we note in particular that
data is a role, not a type. And so it's relative, and
it's relative actually in two senses. First, being a role, not a type,
nothing is data intrinsically, only with respect to use. Because data is not just a role,
it is a social role. So use is critical here. Second, the same propositions
can be data in one circumstance, but a claim supported by data in another. That is, data in one circumstance and
not data in another, Characteristic of being a role. And finally,
need at least one slogan per video, right? It is routinely the case in science, and it is importantly,
routinely the case in science, that often one person's data is
another person's theory. You recall the picture? This is what we'll be alluding to when
we give a short answer to the question, what is data? You might take a moment,
stare at this model for a moment and ask yourself, where's the data? [LAUGH] So here we go, our answer to
the next question, what is data? Data are,
I'll switch to the plural verbs here, data are propositions,
Asserted as evidence. We sometimes say systematically
asserted as evidence. If you want to distinguish casual
argumentation from argumentation supported by a certain
quantity of organized data. I'm not sure that systematically is
really absolutely essential here. Data are propositions
asserted as evidence. There you have it, data
are propositions asserted as evidence. Let's remind ourselves what
we may mean by propositions. Very roughly, two declarative sentences that say the
same thing express the same proposition. Even if they're different sentences, even if they're in different languages,
that's the basic idea. We could also say those things which
are true or false, those are propositions. Those things that can be believed or
doubted, those are propositions. Okay, so much for propositions,
what about assertion? So data are propositions
asserted as evidence. What can we say about assertion? The important thing here is that to be
asserted, propositions must be expressed in a language, encoded in symbols,
and inscribed in material form. And, of course, that encoding in
symbols might be an adapted cascade. And when we say inscribed
in material form, we mean actual patterned matter and
energy. Yeah, the thing sitting right there
on your desktop, or the ink on paper. So to be asserted, propositions must be,
one, expressed in a language. Two, encoded in symbols, and,
three, inscribed in material stuff. And that makes it clear, I think vivid, how human intentionality is
fundamental to the very idea of data. Expressing, encoding, and inscribing are
not things that simply happen in nature. They require conventions that are created
and maintained by communities of persons. They also require particular beliefs,
intentions, and practices based on those conventions. You don't have that, nothing is expressed. And nothing is encoded,
and nothing is inscribed. Okay, so much for propositions, so
much for assertion, now evidence. What is it exactly for
propositions to be evidence for something? This is a requirement,
now, for being data. But what could we say to define it,
or clarify what we mean? You know what, I'm not going to do it. It's kind of a philosophical,
epistemological question. On this one, I'm just going to say,
we know it when we see it, right? When we're arguing in the pub,
we have a sense of what it means for something to be offered as evidence for
something. We know when someone is trying
to back up their claim. So that's it for evidence. Okay, now let's ask whether the property
of being data is a type or a role. We're really asking,
is data a kind of thing? Or is it a role that
things of certain kinds have in particular circumstances? So from our definition,
we're committed to saying that all data consists of propositions. But our definition also entails
that not all propositions are data. Only propositions that
are asserted are data. And not even all asserted
propositions are data. Only those intended to serve as evidence. Reflecting on that,
we pretty quickly come to the conclusion that data is not
a type of thing, it is a role. So just as persons are students
when they're enrolled in a school, propositions are data when
asserted as evidence. And being asserted as evidence
is a contingent circumstance. It's actually a contingent
social circumstance. It requires asserters, [LAUGH] asserters. No assertion without asserters,
so that means persons. So that means not just a contingent
circumstance being asserted as evidence, something which may or may not be
the case, it's a social circumstance. And so we can say,
data is a role that propositions have in certain contingent
social circumstances. All right,
now let's turn our attention for a moment away from data to the thing
data is asserted as evidence for. And ask ourselves, what is that,
and what kind of thing is that? So we think of data as being
asserted as evidence for things like theories, hypotheses,
conjectures, claims, assertions. It's really quite a list,
and perhaps most vividly in my list here,
you see that theories, big, complicated explanatory assertions,
might be quite simple. We're going to ignore this
difference in complexity and explanatory nature and
call all of these things claims. So whether evidence is being asserted in support of the theory
of general relativity. Or whether it's being asserted in support
of identifying the culprit in a burglary. Doesn't matter, for us now,
all of those things are claims. So data is asserted as evidence for
claims. Now, what kind of thing is a claim? A little reflection, I think,
will suggest that both data and claims are ontologically
the same sort of thing, propositions in a role. So data propositions, claims propositions. Different roles, as we're going to see. But the kind of thing in
play here is a proposition. So data are propositions in the role
of being asserted as evidence. Claims are propositions in the role of
being asserted as supported by evidence. A mouthful, but you get the point. So data and claims, both are roles. What makes, in some scenario, propositions
data and, in another, propositions claims? Only the intentions and
actions of a particular person or persons. Nothing intrinsic in the world,
other than those social circumstances. Nothing about a proposition
that makes it evidence. Nothing about a proposition
that makes it a claim. It simply depends upon what's intended,
On the structure of assertion. Again, nothing intrinsic to
data that makes data data. Nothing intrinsic to claims
that makes claims claims. It's the structure of the assertion. So being data is a role that some
propositions have in certain contingent social circumstances,
and the same for claims. There's nothing about any proposition
that prevents it from being evidence or prevents it from being a claim,
Intrinsically. And this allows us to see how data is, in
an important additional sense, relative. Again, we've seen that whether
propositions are data or claims depends upon what is intended. Depends on, you might say,
the structure of assertion. And that propositions can therefore
be data in one circumstance, claims in another. Science as a whole
actually depends on this, science as a large social enterprise. For instance, for a climate scientist, growth rings on tree rounds
might be evidence for theories about temperature changes. But for an evolutionary ecologist, theories about temperature changes
may in turn be evidence for theories about competitive advantages. And in science and
the larger social enterprise sense. In which there's a lot of
interdisciplinarity and collaboration, and we're addressing real-world problems. The relativity of data and
claim is, of course, what to some extent binds
everything together. And allows different communities
to support each other and to draw support from each other. So in a slogan, one person's
data is another person's theory. Apparently, I like ending
my videos with a slogan. And this slogan,
one I'm especially fond of, completes the week of videos,
as well as the video. So with one person's data is another
person's theory, see you next time.
