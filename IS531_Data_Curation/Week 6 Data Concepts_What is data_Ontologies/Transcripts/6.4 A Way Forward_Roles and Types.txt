Hi, everyone. Welcome back. This is the data concepts week. And it's the video types and roles. We're going to use this important
distinction to solve some problems we've just observed and
advance our ontology of data concepts. So in the last video,
we saw how our FRBR-inspired model for representation encountered two problems. Both of them related to
the middle entity types. First, it appeared that the two
middle entity types needed to be collapsed into a single entity type. And second, it appeared that
the two middle entity types needed to be expanded into an indefinite
number of entity types. There's a problem? So obviously,
some refactoring is required. And in this video, we're going to present
the foundation for this refactoring. Describing distinction,
types versus roles, that's become fundamental
in ontological analysis. So you remember our presentation
of the first problem, where it appears that the expression
manifestation entity types, or in the linguistic representation
sentence encoding, are really In every case,
simply symbol structures. And that suggests that we don't need
two rectangles, that one will do. And you remember the second problem, that there appears to be a proliferation
of levels of abstraction. Exactly of the sort that are represented
by the two entity types, only now we have many levels, so
it appears that we need many entity types. And this is especially
vivid in the digital world. You can imagine how in
bibliographic analysis, it wasn't so obvious that there
was an indefinite cascade. But those of us who've been involved with
representing data in digital systems, in computer systems know that
this is a big problem for long lived data management. A big problem for data curators. Okay, I'm going to introduce these two
concepts, role and type intuitively. You can look into this in the readings,
there's a lot more to be said and it's actually fairly complex eventually. But the intuitive ideas are pretty simple. So we're going to distinguish
two kinds of properties. This is about distinguishing
kinds of properties. Those that are roles and
those that are types. So again, we're doing this very roughly. The property of being a student. Is a property that is a role, why? In part, because students
are persons only in virtue of particular contingent circumstances. Namely, being enrolled at a school,
which you may or may not be. And you may become enrolled in school and
later not be. On the other hand, the property of
being a person isn't at all like that. We say the property of
being a person is a type. Because persons are persons regardless
of contingent circumstances. So other examples of properties
that are roles, parent, president, planet nearest the sun,
et cetera. And other properties that are types,
number, color, physical object, copper, water, and so on. Being copper, of course, being water. Now I'm going to drill
down a little further. So the property of rigidity can
help us better understand and distinguish roles and types. Why? Because types are rigid. And roles are not. So let's define rigidity. I've already hinted at it. A property is rigid if and only if nothing that
has it could exist and fail to have it In past, present or the future or
in any alternative circumstances. And examples again, person, number,
color, physical object, copper. Those things, those properties,
if something has them, that thing can't lose them. It can't fail to have had them. It can't have not had them in the past. But a property is a role if and
only if anything that has it could exist and
fail to have it. And again, examples, student, president,
parent, planet nearest the sun. I know these are sort of a mind
bending intricate mouthful. So let's slow down and take our time elucidating exactly
what we're talking about here. Okay, so this is, I know,
mind-numbingly abstract. And we're going to slow down and take our time elucidating a little
further what's going on here. So again,
the property of being a person is rigid means that nothing that is a person
could exist and fail to be a person. So for instance, some physical object,
say your coffee cup, could not have existed and
not been a physical object. It could not, for instance,
have existed and been a number, a color or something entirely substantially
different than a physical object. It might not have existed ,of course. But if that coffee cup existed
at any point in time or in any alternative circumstance,
it's going to be a physical object. Notice I didn't say it's going to
be a coffee cup, that's debatable. But it's not going to be a number. It's not going to be a color. It's not going to be a set or
a class or any of those things. The property of being a student,
however, is not like that. The property of being
a student is not rigid. Things that are students,
like you for instance, and me, a while back, can exist and
not be students. Notice that I have ceased to be a student,
but I still exist. Sometime in the future probably,
you will cease to be a student. Hard as you might try [LAUGH] for
that not to happen. But you need not cease to exist,
just when you cease to be a student. You cease to be a student and
continue to exist. In some alternative universe, you might
never be a student, but still exist. So still sort of unpacking this
intuitively at the bottom of the slide. Once you were not a student,
now you are a student. Soon, you will not be a student. Helps us see why student is a role. On the other hand, everything that
is a person has been a person since it existed and will always
be a person as long as it exists. And the same goes for numbers and
colors and physical objects and so on. Copper, [LAUGH] even. So if you'd like a little more precision
and a little less metaphysics, this distinction can also be
articulated in modal logic. So some of you may be familiar with
first order of predicate logic. Modal logic is simply the addition of
pretty much the addition of the adverb, necessarily. And that's what the box stands for
in this formula here. So in modal logic,
rigidity can be defined as a property. Phi is rigid if and only if necessarily. For everything x, if x has phi,
then x has phi necessarily. And if that intrigues you,
[LAUGH] and it's not of course, I don't imagine, unless you're
already familiar with modal logic, that this is something that can
be absorbed from this slide. Just sort of putting it out there to see if I can intrigue
anybody into looking further. And the place to look is in Guarino and Welty's very influential paper,
A Formal Ontology of Properties. Another way rigidity can be
defined in modal logic is in the model theoretic semantics for
modal logic. And there, it would go roughly like this. A property, phi, is rigid If and only if. If phi is had by some X
in some possible world, then X has phi in every possible
world in which X exists. And needless to say, this account can
also be spelled out with sets and functions and within the general
context of model theory for logic. So if you want a little more precision,
a little less metaphysics, Guarino and Welty is a place to look. Basic idea though, basic intuitive idea,
I think is fairly clear and powerful. So. Are the middle entity types roles or
types? We call them types, but is that warranted? Okay, we'll start with FRBR. So in FRBR, an expression is a simple
structure that realizes a work. Basically, a text, right? That's an expression. Colloquially, we can say
an expression ia a text. Natural language [INAUDIBLE]. A manifestation is a symbol structure
that embodies an expression. In FRBR, of course,
we'd be thinking of the addition. So we reflect on this and observe that symbols have their meanings Only as a result of
contingent social convention. So whether or not an expression
realizes this work or that work or any work really has to do with
the existence of contingent social conventions,
contingent circumstances. And so in different circumstances, the same symbol structures
can mean different things. And this looser contingent connection
between the symbol structure and what it realizes or
embodies suggests that expressions and manifestations are actually roles
that symbol structures have. Now this a little tricky,
because expressions and manifestations are symbol structures,
but they're symbol structures in a role. And the word expression, the word manifestation is
an indication of the role. Not the type. Symbol structure indicates the type. Because after all, it's hard to imagine a symbol structure
ever ceasing to be a symbol structure. Debatable, but at least plausible,
that the things that are symbol structures are intrinsically symbol structures. They'll never cease to
be a symbol structure. And so they're more appropriate as types. Okay. That was the FRBR perspective. Let's look at the linguistic
representation perspective. There, a sentence is a symbol structure
that expresses a proposition. And encoding is a symbol
structure that encodes a sentence. I realize that the double use
of encoding may be distracting, may even sound circular,
but nothing turns on it. We just don't have good
English words here. So in the linguistic model,
a sentence like snow is white, is a symbol structure that
expresses a proposition. And encoding, such as the phonemes,
snow is white or the characters S-N-O-W, et cetera. Those are all different encodings. Those are symbol structures
that encode a sentence. But again, symbols do what they do, whatever they do, only as a result
of contingent social conventions. Could have people on the picture here. In different circumstances, the same
symbol structures mean different things. It's a loose contingent connection,
not a tight essential one. Like you get with the things that
are persons and being a person. So again, both sentence's encodings
would seem to be roles, not types. Which is actually good news for
our comparison between FRBR And linguistic representation, but it does suggest how
the refactoring is going to go. So recall our emerging model
of the type/role relationship. A student is a person
enrolled in a school. And student is a role, person is a type. Being enrolled in a school is a role
that things of a certain type, namely persons, have. And paralleling that model. A sentence is a symbol structure
that expresses a proposition. So being a sentence is a role that
symbol structures have in certain contingent social circumstances. An encoding is a symbol structure
that encodes a sentence. So an encoding is also a role that symbol structures have in
certain social circumstances. But in both cases, a thing we're
talking about is a simple structure. So we can collapse the two
middle entity types. They're both simple structures. The difference between sentence and
encoding is a difference of role, not a difference of type. But wait. [LAUGH]. That just solves half the problem and the
other half pulls in the other direction. How do we deal with
the proliferation problem? This doesn't seem to solve that. Anything, you might say it makes
the problem more puzzling. There's a great solution to that. Here we go. New definitions. A sentence is a symbol structure
that expresses a proposition and encoding is a symbol structure that
encodes either a sentence or an encoding. Everybody's interested in R,
this is the other R, recursion. So once we have this recursive
relationship, a single entity type, namely symbol structure, Can actually represent an indefinite
number of encoding levels through the use of
the relationship encoding. Defined in this recursive way. Now how cool is that? It's very cool. And if you don't think so,
wait till the next video. Thanks. See you soon.
