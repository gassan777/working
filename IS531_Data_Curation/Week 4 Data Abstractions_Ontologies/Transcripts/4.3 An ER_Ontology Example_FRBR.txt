Let's look at an example of developing
an entity-relationship model, which is to say an ontology for
an interesting domain. And a domain that's not just interesting,
challenging in many respects, but also a domain that's very important to data curation and
digital asset management in general. In this video we're going to
show how a fragment of the FRBR, just call it FRBR for now. The FRBR conceptual model was developed in order to support the complexities
of library cataloguing. And although the example,
as an example of Modeling, is from library cataloguing, the solution, the actual conceptual model is
a fairly profound one, the seminal. And it's directly related
to deep important problems in data curation and also, in fact,
to digital asset management in general. Let's start with the question,
what is a book? You might ask someone,
did you read the same book I did? It sounds simple,
did you read the same book I did? And in fact,
that simple phrase the same book conceals some very different sentences. It could mean did you read
the same novel I did? And the answer might be yes, but
I read the French translation. It might mean did you read the same text? I did, but the large type edition. It might mean did you
read the same edition? I did, but I read the copy that
we left in the summer house. Or you might mean did
you read the same copy? Yes I did, the one with the mustard stain. Those are all different things
that we could mean when we ask, did you read the same book? And often we mean one thing and
often we mean another. These are all sentences that
are fairly prominent in conversation. They mean different things. They get different answers
at different times. To see how they get different answers,
read these from bottom to top. If you meant did you read the same copy,
the answer might be no but I read the same edition. If you meant did you
read the same edition? The answer might be no, but
yes I did read the same text. If the question is,
did you read the same text? The answer might be no,
I don't read French, but I did read it in German, and so on. So the ordinary book,
apparently can be simultaneously, for instance, about Manet, in French, typeset in neo-Bauhaus,
and mustard-stained. This is a little peculiar. Is there really one thing that
is about Manet, in French, typeset in Bauhaus and mustard-stained? We talk in ordinary
conversation as if there is. But that's not good enough for
building a database. We can talk like there is one
thing that's about Manet, in French, typeset in neo-Bauhaus and
mustard-stained. But if you're going to develop a database
that's flexible and precise and good enough for hard work,
digital asset management, like running a big academic library,
it's not going to cut it. And the reason is the thing that is about Manet is a work that could be in French, in German, and in English. The thing that's in French is
what's called the expression, which could be typeset in New Times,
typeset in 100 pages, 110 pages, on paper, online. Same expression but different manifestations. And it's the manifestation
that's typeset in neo-Bauhaus. It, of course, exists in many different copies amidst
the copy that's mustard-stained. So I've just introduced
the four key technical terms in the functional requirements for
bibliographic records for FRBR. Which takes the ordinary
concept of a book and replaces it with four other
concepts that are more precise and more suitable for developing a database
to manage intellectual objects. Let's take a closer look at
the Group 1 entity types. Therefore, the work which
is characterized as a distinct intellectual or
artistic creation. The expression,
which is the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in
the form of alphanumeric, musical, or choreographic notations,
sound, image, etc. The manifestation, which is the physical
embodiment of the expression of the work. And the item, which is a single
exemplar of a manifestation. If we were talking about ordinary
physical books, rough synonyms. Ordinary colloquial synonyms for these four concepts would be work, text, edition, and copy. Now to get a better grip on
exactly what's going on here, we're going to look at some attribute
assignments because they tell us a lot about how these concepts work,
what these entity types are. So as is typical in Modeling, every entity type is assigned
a distinctive set of attributes. In this case works will have
attributes like subject and genre. A work is about something. It might be a scientific paper,
novel, poem, something like that. Expressions have attributes such as
language, the text in which a work is expressed will have some language,
or be in some language or other. Manifestations have
attributes like typeface. It's the addition that might
be in Times or [INAUDIBLE]. And items have attributes such
as condition and location. So, important to notice that these attribute assignments are disjoint. We have here four sets of attributes. I haven't shown you all the values
in a domain for each attribute. But trust me,
the domains of attributes for each entity type here, they're disjoint. For example, a work may have a subject but it does not have a language or
a typeface or a condition. Expression has the language, manifestation
has the typeface, item has the condition. An expression may have a language,
it does not have a subject. The work has the subject. A manifestation may have a typeface but it does not have a subject or a language. And an item may have a condition, but
it does not have a subject, language, or typeface. This is not how we talk. But if you reflect on
the problem we face when we notice how the same question
can be answered yes or no in different ways,
you'll see the same question, did you read the same book I read? It becomes clear that the way we
talk is really not very precise. And the world we think we live
in where we have these books that are both in English
about Manet in Times Roman, we don't live in that world, not really. So this approach to understanding
how intellectual objects like books work is actually kind of a generalization
of a long history in library and information science of
thinking about these things. Please don't be misled by
the focus on physical books. FRBR is not just a major event in
cataloguing and technology in libraries. It has become extremely influential
in the development of ontologies for digital asset management and
data creation. An example of noticing how
FRBR can give us insights into data curation is this paper about
FRBR in a scientific context. So now we dig into the actual Modeling. And then it characterizes, this is
a simple, informal approach to Modeling. I'm going to indicate two steps. One is isolate the kinds or the types of
objects and entities that are of interest. When you're doing that,
don't think about data, focus on things. And each entity type will
eventually become a focal point for a cluster of data. Next step is identify the important
attributes for each entity. There's more, but that's enough to remind
us of what we probably already know about Modeling so that we can look at it from
the point of view of data curation. So here is an Diagram for the entity
types that we've just been talking about. Works are realized through expressions,
expressions are embodied in manifestations,
manifestations exemplified by items, each rectangle corresponds to an entity type
that is extensionally a set of entities. This is a set of works, a set of
expressions, a set ot manifestations, a set of items. Let me clarify that this is the set of
all works, the set of all expressions, the set of all manifestations,
the set of all items. And if you want a little more
clarity on just what these are and how they're related. You can read the text on this slide
where we walk through how Moby Dick, the work,
is realized through different expressions, embodied in different manifestations and
exemplified in different items. There's a lot more to fleshing out
a picture of the bibliographic universe than just dealing with
the intellectual object itself. So here on the overview slide,
you see how FRBR divides the bibliographic world up into not just Group 1 entities
that we've been looking at but also entities like person, family,
corporate body, entities types, and types like concepts,
object, event and place. And then characterizes the kinds
of attributes and relationships. And the libraries'
additional relationships, such as translation, abridgement, part of, as you can imagine it
becomes quite complex. Here's a high level picture
of the entity types. And here we have a picture of FRBR from
the point of view of first order logic. That is we articulate the definitions and
first order logic, we note which terms we're using as primitives, meaning
they're only defined in natural language. We give our cardinality axioms,
our domain range axioms, disjointness axioms, and then [INAUDIBLE]. Okay, that's our example of Modeling. It's also preparing us to see how FRBR can be used to develop a robust ontology for contemporary scientific data curation and asset management actually as well. That'll be in a couple weeks. So what you learned here
about FRBR it's an example. It's not just an example, it's going to be part of the substance of working out a adequate ontology for understanding data curation.
