Okay. Welcome back. Hi everyone. This is the data policies week of data curation, policies, and regulations. I know you're hard at work on your project. So, going to keep this one short. It gets shorter as the semester goes by, kind of what's left of course. So, I know you know what policies are but just to be sure, I know you've probably been tormented by policies, probably today already. So, here's a definition of the Cambridge dictionary, a set of ideas or a plan for action followed by a business, government, political party, group of people. Second is a policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. So, whats to notice here? Is that policies are about action and specifically about prescribing action. And as a corollary to that, indicating constraints on action and requirements for action, things that make the action legitimate, things to do things not to do. Policies are not describing the world. Your grammar teacher would say that policies are in the imperative mood not the indicative or declarative mood. They instruct. You must do this or you should do this and there is a slight difference. Or if you do this, you must do that. Hypothetical, It's supposed to categorical. Speaking of which, here are two important types of data policies. In fact, you might say that data policies fall into these two categories. The first is regulatory. These are policies that for one reason or another you must follow. And the reason is often, it's the law. So, these are extremely important policies. If you don't follow them you can be exposed to considerable financial liability and even expose to criminal prosecution. Sometimes regulatory or for the most part regulatory policies are hypothetical in this sense. If you, then you must. If you are doing, then you must. We sometimes say something like, "If you want to play then you must conform. If you don't want to conform, you're not going to be playing." The other kind is exhortative policies. And here, there is not the force of law or absolute institutional company policy. It's rather, we advise you to adopt this practice or standard, record this information, use this format et cetera. So, there's not even, if you don't do it we won't hire you. If you don't do it, we won't fund your project. Those are light kind of regulatory policies. Exhortative policy say, you really should do this, but if you don't, you're not in trouble and no action will be taken against you. So, those are the two kinds. The first kind, great example, health policies, education policies about privacy particular for a financial information, security policy, variety of policies there. And then second kind, exhortative, the NSF data sharing policy which is still fairly exhortative but becoming increasingly regulatory, our own open access policy and then specific policies and specific professional societies, domains or communities. Those are the kinds of policies, what do they cover? Well, obviously, policies can cover different kinds of content. So, policies can be about kinds of data and they can be about kinds of data formats, requiring a certain kind for instance, requiring that you always include particular information for instance. They can be about the process of submitting data who's to a repository, who's eligible for submission, what the repository is allowed to do, what the data quality must be to be deposited, what data quality will be maintained, confidentiality, how will that be maintained by the repository archive and also whether or not they accept embargo's. Preservation. Often you're required to preserve data and to preserve it for a certain amount of time and with a certain functionality and a test fixity. Then on the other side of the archive desk, archives will promise to retain your data and keep its functionality untested for to ensure ongoing fixity and authenticity. Metadata is frequently required in various policies, are required often to record certain metadata elements. Sometimes you're required to use certain metadata schemas. And of course, it's because it facilitates, we talked about this 100 times, access, findability, discoverability, if you will access, reuse, integration so on. Speaking of which, already stepped on the next item here access and reuse. But one additional thing alluded to here is that you are sometimes required in certain circumstances to track the users of data. If you're a repository, people of deposit want to know who got their data. Sometimes you're required to reuse data and sometimes you're required to do things that make it reusable. There are also conditions on withdrawal. Under what condition can you not just access data that perhaps it's yours, perhaps you deposited it in archive, but under what conditions are you allowed to remove it from the archive. And, it's a big deal because removing data from an archive can actually have unexpected effects if users have been depending on it and in particular if you did not anticipate users being dependent on it. Suddenly it's gone, and yes, your phone is ringing. Now, scope, scope and domains really. So, policies can come from many places. They can come from the government obviously and then it's typically legal, regulatory, force of law, professional associations more likely to be exhortative policies, consortia, companies, especially companies with archives in your project and team, and often any particular project that's underway. It's going to be located at an intersection of these broad areas government, domain, organization of policy generation. And one of the challenges here is that as well as these, just look at these circles: government, domain, organization. They are all kinds of domains that are often involved in a complicated project that has multidisciplinary data say for organizations even governments, you can be using data that is generated in one country is moved to another or accessed from another for analysis. And the data is about a third country and it's being made accessible in a fourth country. And in fact, you can combine those scenarios when you combine sources of data. So you have almost combinatoric explosion of regulatory environments that can be extremely difficult to navigate. One nation says you can do this but not that, another says you can do that but not this. And then that's just for one kind of data, you got multiple nations, you've got different kinds of data, you've got a workflow that chops up the different intervals, the different parts of the process over different nations. You get the idea. It's increasingly a big legal slash technological challenge to navigate this stuff. And it's extremely important because a lot of money is involved and a lot of opportunity is there that's difficult to take advantage of if we can't figure out a way through this regulatory maze. The regulatory maze, why didn't I use that for a video title? Okay, well that's our introduction to policies and regulation. See you all in the next video.
