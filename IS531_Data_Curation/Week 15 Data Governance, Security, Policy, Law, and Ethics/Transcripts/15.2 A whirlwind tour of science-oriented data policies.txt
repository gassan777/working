Hi everyone. Welcome back. This is the policy week, policy and regulations. This is the second video. It's going to be a whirlwind tour of science-oriented data policies just as an example in one domain of a few of thick sorts of policies that are involved in data curation. We could, as I said, talk about this for a long time in any particular domain. So just a glance. And in particular, we're going to be looking at policies from NIH, National Institutes of Health, that is emphasized, and others. The National Institutes of Health, major source of policies related to data especially, obviously, by medical data, health data, but actually goes further than that. Especially important are their policies regarding sharing. This is a hot topic these days in the data science of scientific research. We talked about this earlier, how do we encourage researchers to share data, to share their publications, to share clinical trial information. Policies designed to help with that come from NIH. Of course, longstanding policies for Responsible Conduct of Research. This is to ensure scientific integrity, people are cooking stuff up, be hacking and all that, and also to make sure that everyone is trained on what it means to do responsible conduct of research. Because it's not just about making sure people, scientists, don't cheat, it's also about making sure that they're careful and that they understand how inadvertence and carelessness can result in wasted funding and confusing, even dangerous research results. And of course, intellectual property, all those issues around patents and trade secrets, and copyright, and so on. So as I said, data sharing, extremely important. And NIH is getting a lot of attention to it now and has for a while. Draw your attention to the first bullet point here. NIH policy on data sharing applies to the sharing of final research data for research purposes. Note that this is indicating that only certain kinds of data fall under the NIH data sharing policies. And this is a common characteristic of data policies, of policies in general. So again, NIH data sharing policies are at least the relevant ones from which, abstract to this bullet point, are about the sharing of final, not preliminary, not intermediate, not your notes, no one's after those, final research data, research data. Not data you've collected for other things. For instance, the management of your lab, and research data for research purposes. And then another simple example, applicants seeking half a million dollars or more indirect cost, the data sharing policy applies to them. But we're exempting smaller projects really probably for the most part because it's just too arduous for them to figure out what they should do and do it. This data sharing encouraged by NIH has resulted in really some tremendous resources that would not have been possible without these policies. And those include, if you look on the right, these very important, very large sophisticated data repositories on cancer imaging and proteins and genomics and wide variety of things that everybody uses, everybody contributes to. Without that contribution, the entire community, entities, and other data repositories, we wouldn't have the progress we have in biomedical science. NIH also has policies around public access to scientific publications as well as scientific data. And these are also extremely important policies that had a tremendous positive impact on science, really unnoted, unheralded, but extremely important, extremely influential. So, I'm going to read this sentence from one of the policies. I like this sentence, it's really, you might say, it's the thought, the sentence behind a lot of scientific progress that we've enjoyed and a lot of information dissemination, deserves to be read as if it were a scripture. Here we go. "All investigators funded by the NIH must submit to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication." This is what has produced a tremendous resource. Notice of course, PubMed, PubMed Med Lib. If you haven't been there, you probably have, whether for professional or hypochondriacal reasons. Follow this link. It's an incredible repository of information of results of scientific analysis, new directions, methods, possible collaborators, and so on in the biomedical area. Hard to imagine science without PubMed. National Science Foundation also has data sharing policies. And this also is a sentence from one of their documents. Here we go. "Investigators are expected to share with other researchers at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of work under NSF grants." You got to share. If you don't, don't expect to be funded by the NSF. And NSF also has policies around data management plans. They require that you have a data management plan and they have some specifics not a lot. It's really pretty open-ended about what must be included in your data management plan and those specifics also include sharing and dissemination. Follow this link but take a look at those plans. The size directorate, very important to us here at Illinois Computer and Information Science Engineering, NSF, but a director in the NSF has its own specifications for data management plans. And I encourage you to take a look at those. They encourage you to document your standards to have policies again for access and sharing to manage privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property, all these things, archives, and metadata, all of these things specified in a relatively general level, not too hard to comply. Nobody wants to add another obstacle to research. We want to make sure that research can be discovered when it's relevant and be accessed. You can figure out whether or not you can use it. You can read it in your tools. You can combine it with other data. You haven't violated any federal state laws. It's there to be all those things. Liable efficient and these policies are specifically designed to ensure that. There are a good thing. I know they're irritating. I've been irritated in the past but makes the world a better place even if now and then it makes our lives a little bit harder. The truth is, if you're in the game for long, it'll make your life easier later to have followed these policies. You'll be doing your future self a favor, as Karen likes to say. Before we leave this whirlwind tour, I want to indicate a different kind of policy. The policy of a particular archive. This is the Digital Conservancy at the University of Minnesota. And they'll take your data and you'll pay them to take your data, and they'll take care of it. They take care of it at different levels of care, and to describe those levels and as you do deposit and be okay with paying for services. They begin on the slide we're looking at by defining these three concepts: stability, accessibility and usability. And these are the things that they support in varying degrees. I encourage you to take a look at, sort of the slides a little fuzzy, but I think it's readable. Take a look at what they mean by fixity, bitstream, integrity, check by checksums, accessibility, persistent access with identifiers, usability, and so on. Take a look. In here on this slide, you see that they characterize their three levels of support for limited and minimal in terms of what they deliver with respect to those three categories of support. So full support level one will take all reasonable actions to maintain usability, actions may include migration, emulation, or normalization. Remember this? And the preservation slides will ensure access and data fixity. So, they're going to work hard to make sure that your data is like always usable and you know what it is. And whoever gets it knows what it is. Limited support, will take limited steps to maintain usability. May actively transform a file from one format to another to mitigate format obsolescence, will ensure access and data fixity. Access and data fixity, not so hard. That's why they will ensure that, they remind to do a checksum. And minimal support, level three, will provide for access to the item in its submission format only. They're not going to transform it, will work to ensure a data fixity, it'll be hard. And at least, that something will cost you as much. It won't be quite as valuable either to you or other users as time goes by without the extra attention. But at least, it's somewhere. And with that, growing a deeper mark, at least, it's somewhere. This is the end of the whirlwind tour. See you in the next video.
