Welcome back, everyone. You know I was going to discuss privacy, right? So the laws, the data, the challenges, the remedies, some of the remedies, anyway, there's a lot to privacy. So just doing the water and not towards all that really embarrassing stuff in your hard disk that's outside the file system. For you, it's just embarrassing but the companies, the army, the government, it's not just embarrassing. Here are some privacy-related policies. I encourage you to surf them up, extremely important. If you're involved with the university, extremely important Privacy Act of '74 by the jurisprudence, FOIA, for IRB and financial stuff. All kinds of things are regulated by privacy law. Names, of course, geographic locations, especially those that like zip codes, dates, telephone numbers, somewhere and so forth. All of these things are regulated by some privacy policy, frequently a regulatory one, some policy or other. So HIPAA and FERPA particularly important for people working in universities, hospitals and where there's a lot to these policies. It's hard to know exactly what you're allowed to do. That's part of the problem. How you handle the data, how you protect them, it's prescribed. Coming up with an actual physical and a virtual secure environment, which in some cases you have to do managing access rights. A challenge, obviously, and I don't think that society really knows what consent, privacy and even harm in the digital world, the social media. Read the newspaper this last couple week. There's a lot of attention being given to collected cellphone information and whether that's private to whom and what circumstances. So HIPAA, in general, it's huge, and it's a lot of it's about health insurance. So it establishes, among other things, standards for transactions. So there's format-related policies in there, and there's financial-related policies. And as you see, company-owned insurance policies. But the privacy that we're interested in, I'm going to read that rule from the Health Human Services website, HIPAA: "establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically." In a pause there, what does this have to do with me if I don't work in a hospital, if I don't work for an insurance company? If you do, research that involves health care information. This applies to you as well. "The Rule requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal health information, and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures," and enormous financial liabilities if you fail to conform, and bad things happen as a result. Well, just take a look at this slide, and you'll see the 18 identifiers that are in HIPAA that receive special attention for privacy. They include vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, and now we descent from the top. PHI,, personal health information, any information in the medical record or designated record set, that's where things get challenging. You take a number of records together, and they can imply that they have implications that are violations even on the individual records that's created. Used to identify the individual, and that was created, used or disclosed in the course of providing health care service, such as diagnosis or treatment. Doctor ask questions, he writes something down or types it into his device. And now, we are in the domain. We're in the portfolio of HIPAA and have to act accordingly. There are lots of different techniques for trying to protect privacy. One of them is to get the participants to basically give up privacy in any event you want them to give consent to collecting information. Anonymizing records in various ways, some ways are simple. You remove values, or you replace a specific value with the more general value, or you combine values in ways that make the result general. You can obliterate on access that's redaction so that the information is there, but it's not made available on access. You can aggregate records so that you lose a lot of information, but you have the aggregate information you need. Then there's some really sophisticated statistical methods that some of you may actually be working on. I don't think that include even adding information that distorts the record in some respects but not in the respects that matter. So here's an illustration of some of the techniques for anonymizing. See, we're sort of giving a particular date or personally given for person's DB. We give an age range, particular city. We go to a US city and make a name for them. We generalize their role. These are all things that in certain circumstances can be done to achieve some level of the hope anonymization without interfering with the purposes of the record. And, finally, just a note at the problem of information in storage devices that is not in the file system. So you may delete files. You may even try to reformat, and how can you be sure that actually all the information is gone just because you don't see it in the files you see, just because you reformatted your desk? How can you be sure that you've managed to actually remove or obliterate information in the hard disk, I mean, other than like putting it in the trash compactor? And if you're interested in that sort of thing, surf to BitCurator, which works at the disk-level with the locking system of the store or a storage device and allows you to get those credit card numbers and social security numbers off your hard disk even when they work in corners of the disk that are outside the file system. And it's pretty interesting if you like this technical kind of stuff specially on the system side. So please do take a look. Privacy, I'll say in general. You know these reading newspapers and magazines enormous amount of attention right now. And apart from the technical issues or technological issues and the legal issues, it's clear that as a society, we don't really have a good understanding anymore of what is appropriately private and what isn't in the digital age and especially when there are frankly a lot of advantages even individuals for giving up some of their privacy. If you use Uber, you know that I'm giving up privacy about where you are, can make your day a little easier. All right. And with that, we reach the end of the last video in the policy week. A lot to think about, maybe there's a lot to be recruited out. I don't know. We all have our different privacy, personal privacy profiles. Some of us don't care what some of us do and some of us do. With that little philosophical reflection, I'll say goodbye and see you next week. Hope your projects are going well and hope you're having fun.
