Okay, in this video we ask the question
what is data preservation? And we'll attempt to give a precise, accurate, rigorous answer. In the case of data preservation that's
a lot harder than you might think. I also believe it's a lot more
important than you might think. This is not just an idle
philosophical exercise. The problem is that we don't have a good definition of data preservation and
data use, and that is in fact problematic. So looking at the content slide right now,
we're going to start by noticing the common definitions
are misleading at best. And the problem behind the common
definitions is that it's not clear what, at least with respect to
digital data preservation, what exactly is being preserved? What ontologically speaking,
is being preserved? If we were to do a conceptual
model of data preservation. We're not quite sure what entity type is going to be the entity type for
the thing that is preserved. And in fact, we have a radical answer
to the question what is preserved and that answer is nothing is preserved. We will give you a definition, I don't want to spoil the drama
in suspense but it's coming. And I'll say a few words about
why this definition is important. First two examples of definitions
of deterioration that are typical, these are the kind of
definitions you're apt to see. The first is from the Society
from American Archivists and particularly interesting for
the story that's unfolding in this video. The professional discipline, this is
the definition of data preservation. The professional discipline of protecting
materials by minimizing chemical and physical deterioration and
damage to minimize the loss of information and
extend the life of cultural property. Notice the focus here
on physical materials. When they say chemical,
physical deterioration damage, they're talking about physical materials. When you think about preservation
of digital materials, you're thinking about maintaining
the integrity of the object, keeping it from falling apart,
keeping it from oxidizing and so on. The US Library of Congress realizes
that a traditional definition of preservation doesn't really work, but
they don't really improve on it much. This is the one you saw in the last video. The active management of digital content
over time to ensure ongoing access. At one level this sounds okay, but at another level,
what does access mean here? And for that matter,
what does management of content mean? And finally, perhaps most importantly,
if somewhat obscurely, what does it mean to ensure access? Think they're on the right track, but they really haven't gotten
very far down that track. I like to start by reminding
you of our data ontology. Not for nothing did we work so
hard on developing this data ontology. Here it is, three entity types. Propositional content, symbol structure
and patterned matter and energy. And relationships that are maintained by contingent social circumstances. Is expressed by,
is encoded by, is inscribed in. Now looking at this data ontology, looking at this diagram with its three
entity types, ask yourself this. In a successful preservation scenario, that is when we have
succeeded in preserving data, what exactly is preserved? What is preserved? I know we say, we successfully preserved
this dataset or something like that. But really what is preserved? And your answer should be
chosen from our diagram. If this diagram is the right diagram,
the answer to what exactly is preserved should be chosen from one
of the three rectangles. It's either something,
which is propositional content, symbol structure Patterned matter and
energy. Which entity type is the entity type for
the thing that is preserved? That's the question. Have you marked your ballots? Okay, let's try a lower, lower to the earth here, entity type. Patterned matter and energy. When we're asking whether or
not that's the right entity type, what we're really asking is, is it
some physical thing that is preserved? Maybe it is, maybe the thing that's
preserved is in the patterned matter and energy empty type. Of course, what's in that entity
type are things like disks, actual disks, thumb drives, hard drives,
RAID arrays, things like that. Now sure, we absolutely need
to take care of these things. In any preservation scenario, we cannot
be careless of these physical objects. But the question is not whether or
not we need to take care of these physical things in a scenario of
data preservation, but whether or not these physical things
are the things that are preserved. And if you think about it,
you see that well, no. [LAUGH] It can't be the physical thing. For one thing. Preservation of data can be
successful even as the individual physical media disappear Or
become inoperable. So clearly, the continuing existence and
integrity of some physical object is not necessary for
preservation. Because you could succeed at preservation
even though as time goes by, there's no particular physical thing that endured throughout that
entire period of time. You probably moved your data from floppy disks to 3.5 inch disks to external drives to thumb drives to raid arrays. And as you did this,
the disk that you were using eventually, well who knows what? You lost them, you sold them, they threw them out in the garbage,
but they were not preserved. So the preservation of a physical
thing can't be what is preserved. It can't be all there is
to data preservation, because it's not even necessary for
data preservation. In fact as we'll see later, one of the strategies
in data preservation is to discard physical media in migration. That's one way you can actually
accomplish preservation. Let's move on,
How about propositional content? We jumped up now to the top entity type, The northwest corner there. So maybe what's preserved
are things that belong to the propositional content entity type. Now what would that be? That would be things like observations,
claims, assertions, facts, stuff like that. But here's the thing,
did those things really need preservation? Consider this assertion, 100,000
people live in zip code area 61820. Now that presumably is a proposition or
observation claim, assertion, fact, whatever you want to call it. It's the kind of thing that is in
propositional content rectangle. It's entity type is propositional content, But does it need preservation? Does that claim? I'm not talking about the sentence, I'm not talking about toner,
if you've printed this out. I'm talking about the assertion,
which is an assertion that you're thinking about and I'm thinking about and
tomorrow somebody else can think about it. It can be thought about on multiple
continents at the same time. It's not a thing in the physical world. It can't crumble, it can't oxidize. It can't dissolve, mold, it doesn't require our intervention to persist. So some things just cannot decay. And if you can't decay, you can't be the object of preservation in the original archival
sense of preservation. So we're not preserving
propositional content and data preservation, because it will
persist even without any help from us. And now, we're down to, One more entity type,
and it's the last one. This is the symbol structure entity type. If anything's being preserved, it had
better be this because nothing left. So maybe it is, maybe what is preserved,
what we preserve and we preserve data. We are preserving things of
the symbol structure entity type. It has some plausibility on the surface. The problem is symbol structures like propositions are not physical objects. They have physical abstatiations,
but they are not physical objects. So they also don't need preservation. So here's an example,
this is just a kind of a triple. Simply we're saying that as we did before,
that it's a certain ZIP code. It's a certain population and
we're saying it using an imagined language for
triples, kind of like in three. So this symbol structure is a repeatable
sequence of tokens for characters. And what I mean by repeatable
is that it is an abstract thing that can be
articulated multiple times. It's not something that comes
into existence out of atoms and has a causal story involving matter and
energy and then dissipates. It's instantiations in
the physical world have those properties, but
this is simply a sequence. In this case, a sequence of characters,
not a thing in the physical world. So it too, cannot oxidize, fall apart, dissolve, get moldy and so on. And so once again, symbol structures
also do not need our help surviving the, as I say here the vicissitudes of nature. In addition, it is the same with disks and other pattern energy media. We often support preservation of data by
deliberately changing simple structures. For instances,
replacing one obsolete language or format with a different or
newer language or format. So far from it being the format, that is the thing preserved that persists throughout the entire
preservation scenario. It need not persist, and often, preservation strategy is
one that discards an old symbol structure in favor of
a newer symbol structure. We're out of entity types,
[LAUGH] you may wonder wow, maybe there's something
wrong with our ontology. Maybe this is a sign that we've left
something out, I don't think so. So what is preserved? We've just observed that it can't be
any of the things in our data ontology. I would say the answer is,
nothing is preserved. The rhetoric of preservation
is very misleading. That is the natural language
sentences about preservation, suggest that something is
preserved in preservation, but in fact, nothing is preserved. Or, a little more charitably,
a little less paradoxically, no thing is preserved in preservation. Something else is going on. What is it? I'm going to continue to
drive the point home for just one more slide, [LAUGH]
And then we'll move to the positive
part of defining data preservation. So again, data preservation
is not about preserving data. I know that sounds paradoxical. Data preservation is not
about preserving data. That's what we've seen. It's true that preserving physical
objects in the traditional sense of preservation is
part of data preservation. But that is preserving a disk for
some period of time. But it's only part. So preservation of physical media must
occur for some intervals of time, yeah. But data preservation, as we've noted, can also take place even in
particular media decay and in fact often we deliberately discard media as
part of a data preservation strategy. So, maintaining the integrity
of physical media for some interval can be necessary. But it's not necessary to
preserve it throughout the entire data preservation scenarios. In fact we may have a strategy for preservation that requires discarding
it in favor of newer media. Similarly, preserving propositions and symbol structures are also
not necessary for data preservation. In this case, they're not part
preservation in the traditional sense of propositions and symbol structures,
that is, assertions and coding. Not part of data preservation at all,
at all. [LAUGH] And that's because they cannot
decay, they are not physical objects. In addition,
their continued existence which they have, because they're not physical objects,
doesn't ensure preservation. So the fact that propositions continue
to exist, the symbol structures continue to exist, that doesn't mean
that any preservation has happened. So not only do they not need
preservation intervention to continue to exist, but
even when they continue to exist as they do that does
not ensure preservation. [COUGH] I can't resist one
more paradoxical claim. Preservation is not about preservation. Data preservation is not about
preserving the existence of objects. And here's the pasta part you've
been waiting for I'm sure, for the last three or four slides. Well then, what is it about? It's about communication with the future. And I think the best simple
definition of preservation is ensuring reliable
communication with the future. That's what preservation is about. Ensuring reliable
communication with the future. [BLANK AUDIO]. Now in outline, and more exactly, or maybe I should say more exactly,
but in outline. [LAUGH] What this means is, preservation actions
are intended to ensure that future researchers or
other users of data, one, will come into possession of
physical media and encodings. Two, from which they will correctly recognize the originally
intended propositional content. Three, and
from which they will be justified in believing that this
propositional content is in fact the intended
propositional content. And that is a conceptually sound definition of what we really mean when we say preservation. And I know it sounds like I'm
talking about people here, but that's just kind of
a device you can make a similar characterization that
focuses on software agents, as indicated here in the footnote. But the key thing, and this is important, is that what we're doing when we do data preservation, is make it possible for someone in the future to understand what we intend to communicate. And to be confident, That they're justified in believing that that is what we intended to communicate. That's data curation, and
when you understand it for what it really is,
you have a much better grasp of what kinds of interventions
are necessary to make it happen. That is what kinds of
interventions are necessary in order to ensure reliable
communication with the future.
