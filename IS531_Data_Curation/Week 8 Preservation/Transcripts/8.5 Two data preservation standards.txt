Okay, this is the preservation
week video titled, Two Data Preservation Standards. It's going to be a short one. I just want to draw your attention
to the two extremely important and complementary data preservation standards. I think it's fair to say
these are the most important standards specifically
oriented to preservation. And going to draw your attention to them,
say a few words about each, but then encourage you to
explore them on your own. So OAIS,
the Open Archival Information System, amodel for data archives. So this was developed for space data. And somewhat, you might say, and probably has turned out to be,
by far the most influential, high level data archiving
standard model that there is. And it's very widely applied to all
kinds of data preservation projects. It is very comprehensive,
it's also very high level. That means, it's a general framework. It's not a specific set of rules,
formats, techniques, etc of the sort that you
would need to develop when actually archiving,
preserving data of specific kinds. So I have the URL right
here to the documentation. Take a look at the documentation,
and also surf around the web and get a sense of how OAIS is
being discussed and used. I will show you a couple
diagrams from OAIS. This one, I think,
making it clear that this is a high level model for
data preservation archiving. You represent the producer of the data,
the consumer of the data, the ingesting of the data package into the system, along with its
descriptive information, metadata, right? And then, coming out to the consumer,
you'd often response to a query, the data and descriptive information. Pay attention in particular to
the concept of a designated community. When we think about preservation and
archiving, it becomes clear that we have certain
communities in mind for use of the data. And that helps us understand
just what we need to do, what we need to say, and how we need to
say and do it to serve those communities. Here's a little more detail
of an information package. Again, you can see that the Information
Object contains the actual data. And it also contains
representation information about how that data is being represented. This would be the encoding, syntax, and conceptual information. And then there's also preservation
specific information, at least in some sense,
at least information that's especially
important to preservation. Provenance, where the data come from,
contextual information, access rights, fixity, ones and zeros
in the right order, that kind of thing. So, take a look. The other standard I'd like
you to look at is PREMIS. And PREMIS is also a very influential
data preservation standard, specifically a standard for
preservation metadata. And although it's general in some respects, it is more specific, less general, that is, than OAIS. And you've already seen an example in
the last video of some PREMIS metadata. Please take a look. Surf to this website,
you won't have any trouble finding it. It's maintained at the US Library
of Congress in the Standards area, and extremely influential and widely used. A lot of integration and preservation success is due to the wide use of PREMIS. So, as I said, short video,
just want to draw your attention to these two very important
preservation standards and encourage you to review them,
look at them on your own.
