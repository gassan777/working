leak detection system 
since oil gas pipeline important asset economic development almost country ha required either government regulation internal policy ensure safety asset population environment pipeline run 
pipeline company face government regulation environmental constraint social situation 
government regulation may define minimum staff run operation operator training requirement pipeline facility technology application required ensure operational safety 
example state washington mandatory pipeline operator able detect locate leak percent maximum flow within fifteen minute les 
social factor also affect operation pipeline 
product theft sometime also problem pipeline company 
thi case detection level two percent maximum flow high expectation location accuracy 
variou technology strategy implemented monitoring pipeline physically walking line satellite surveillance 
common technology protect pipeline occasional leak computational pipeline monitoring cpm 
cpm take information field related pressure flow temperature estimate hydraulic behavior product transported 
estimation completed result compared field reference detect presence anomaly unexpected situation may related leak 
american petroleum institute ha published several article related performance cpm liquid pipeline 
apus publication ram computational pipeline monitoring liquid pipeline apus pipeline variable uncertainty effect leak detectability 
pipeline containing pass road railway usually enclosed protective casing 
thi casing vented atmosphere prevent build flammable gase corrosive substance allow air inside casing sampled detect leak 
casing vent pipe protruding ground often double warning marker called casing vent marker 
implementation 
pipeline generally laid underground temperature les variable 
pipeline usually metal thi help reduce expansion shrinkage occur weather change however case necessary cros valley river pipeline bridge 
pipeline centralized heating system often laid ground overhead 
pipeline petroleum running permafrost area tran alaska pipeline often run overhead order avoid melting frozen ground hot petroleum would result sinking pipeline ground 
maintenance 
maintenance pipeline include checking cathodic protection level proper range surveillance construction erosion leak foot land vehicle boat air running cleaning pig anything carried pipeline corrosive 
pipeline maintenance rule covered code federal regulationscfr section cfr natural gas pipeline cfr petroleum liquid pipeline

onshore offshore pipeline used transport oil gas regulated pipeline hazardou material safety administration phmsa 
certain offshore pipeline used produce oil gas regulated mineral management service mm 
canada pipeline regulated either provincial regulator cros provincial boundary canada border national energy board neb 
government regulation canada united state require buried fuel pipeline must protected corrosion 
often economical method corrosion control use pipeline coating conjunction cathodic protection technology monitor pipeline

pipeline geopolitic 
pipeline major energy resource petroleum natural gas merely element trade 
connect issue geopolitic international security well construction placement control oil gas pipeline often figure prominently state interest action 
notable example pipeline politic occurred beginning year wherein dispute russium ukraine ostensibly pricing led major political crisi 
russian state owned gas company gazprom cut natural gas supply ukraine talk ukrainian government fell 
addition cutting supply ukraine russian gas flowing ukrainewhich included nearly supply southeastern europe supply central western europewa cut creating major crisi several country heavily dependent russian gas fuel 
russium wa accused using dispute leverage attempt keep power particularly european union interfering near abroad 
oil gas pipeline also figure prominently politic central asium caucasu 
hazard identification 
solvent fraction dilbit typically comprise volatile aromatic like naptha benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization expected follow ground spillostensibly enabling timely intervention leaving viscou residue slow migrate 
effective protocol minimize exposure petrochemical vapour well established oil spilled pipeline would unlikely reach aquifer unles incomplete remediation followed introduction another carrier eg series torrential downpour 
introduction benzene volatile organic compound collectively btex subterranean environment compound threat posed pipeline leak 
particularly followed rain pipeline breach would result btex dissolution equilibration benzene water followed percolation admixture aquifer 
benzene cause many health problem carcinogenic epa maximum contaminant level mcl set gl potable water although well studied single benzene exposure event linked acute carcinogenesi additionally exposure livestock mainly cattle benzene ha shown cause many health issue neurotoxicity fetal damage fatal poisoning 
entire surface ground pipeline directly examined material breach 
pooled petroleum unambiguou readily spotted indicate location required repair 
effectivenes remote inspection limited cost monitoring equipment gap sensor datum require interpretation small leak buried pipe sometime go undetected 
pipeline developer alway prioritize effective surveillance leak 
buried pipe draw fewer complaint 
insulated extreme ambient temperature shielded ultraviolet ray les exposed photodegradation 
buried pipe isolated airborne debris electrical storm tornado hurricane hail acid rain 
protected nesting bird rutting mammal wayward buckshot 
buried pipe les vulnerable accident damage eg automobile collision les accessible vandal saboteur terrorist 
exposure 
previou work ha shown worst case exposure scenario limited specific set condition 
based advanced detection method pipeline shut sop developed transcanada risk substantive large release short period time contaminating groundwater benzene unlikely detection shutoff remediation procedure would limit dissolution transport benzene 
therefore exposure benzene would limited leak limit detection go unnoticed extended period time leak detection monitored scada system assess pressure volume flow every second 
pinhole leak release small quantity cannot detected scada system flow could accumulate substantive spill detection pinhole leak would come visual olfactory inspection aerial surveying mas balance inconsistency assumed pinhole leak discovered within day inspection interval however snow cover location eg remote deep could delay detection 
benzene typically make oil varying degree volatility dissolution based environmental factor 
even pipeline leak volume within scada detection limit sometime pipeline leak misinterpreted pipeline operator pump malfunction problem 
enbridge line crude oil pipeline failure marshall michigan july wa thought operator edmonton column separation dilbit pipeline 
leak wetland along kalamazoo river wa confirmed hour happened local gas company employee michigan 
spill frequency volume 
although pipeline hazardou material safety administration phmsa ha standard baseline incident frequency estimate number spill transcanada altered assumption based improved pipeline design operation safety whether adjustment justified debatable assumption resulted nearly fold decrease spill estimate given pipeline cross mile ogallala aquifer entire pipeline length year life entire pipeline expected spill approximately spill expected occur aquifer 
estimate spill aquifer lasting day result day potential exposure year lifetime pipeline 
reduced scope worst case exposure scenario volume pinhole leak max flow rate day ha estimated barrel million gallon oil according phmsa incident database spill last year barrel 
benzene fate transport 
scenario benzene leaching groundwater 
benzene considered light aromatic hydrocarbon high solubility high volatilityclarification needed unclear temperature depth would impact volatility benzene assumption made benzene oil weight volume would volatilize equilibrating water using octanol water partition coefficient year precipitation event area worst case estimate mgl benzene anticipated flow toward aquifer actual movement plume groundwater system well described although one estimate billion gallon water ogallala aquifer could become contaminated benzene concentration mcl final environmental impact statement state department include quantitative analysi assumed benzene volatilize 
previou dilbit spill remediation difficulty
