technology oil transportation ha evolved alongside oil industry 
although human use oil reach prehistory first modern commercial exploitation date back jame young manufacture paraffin early oil began exported upper burma british colony 
oil wa moved earthenware vessel river bank wa poured boat hold transportation britain 
pennsylvanium oil field became major supplier oil center innovation edwin drake struck oil near titusville pennsylvanium break bulk boat barge originally used transport pennsylvanium oil gallon wooden barrel transport barrel several problem 
first problem wa weight standard empty barrel weighed pound kg representing total weight full barrel problem barrel expense tendency leak fact generally used 
expense wa significant example early year russian oil industry barrel accounted half cost petroleum production 
early design 
two sail driven tanker built england river tyne followed first oil tank steamer vaderland wa built palmer shipbuilding iron company belgian owner vessel use wa curtailed belgian authority citing safety concern pennsylvanium oil field making limited use oil tank barge cylindrical railroad tank car similar use today 
modern oil tanker 
modern oil tanker wa developed period ludvig robert nobel brother alfred nobel founded branobel short brother nobel baku azerbaijan 
wa late th century one largest oil company world 
zoroaster world first tanker delivered nobel brother russium 
ludvig wa pioneer development early oil tanker 
first experimented carrying oil bulk single hulled barge turning hi attention self propelled tankship faced number challenge 
primary concern wa keep cargo fume well away engine room avoid fire challenge included allowing cargo expand contract due temperature change providing method ventilate tank 
first successful oil tanker wa zoroaster carried long ton kerosene cargo two iron tank joined pipe one tank wa forward midship engine room wa aft ship also featured set vertical watertight compartment extra buoyancy ship length overall foot beam foot draft foot unlike later nobel tanker zoroaster design wa built small enough sail sweden caspian way baltic sea lake ladoga lake onega rybinsk mariinsk canal volga river 
oil tanker design took large step forward 
working nobel company british engineer colonel henry swan designed set three nobel tanker instead one two large hold swan design used several hold spanned width beam ship hold subdivided port starboard section longitudinal bulkhead earlier design suffered stability problem caused free surface effect oil sloshing side side could cause ship capsize thi approach dividing ship storage space smaller tank virtually eliminated free surface problem thi approach almost universal today wa first used swan nobel tanker blesk luman lux gl ckauf grounded heavy fog blue point beach fire island 
point gluckauf another design colonel swan first modern oil tanker 
adopted best practice previou oil tanker design create prototype subsequent vessel type 
wa first dedicated steam driven ocean going tanker world wa first ship oil could pumped directly vessel hull instead loaded barrel drum wa also first tanker horizontal bulkheadpage needed feature included cargo valf operable deck cargo main piping vapor line cofferdam added safety ability fill ballast tank seawater empty cargo ship wa built britain wa purchased wilhelm anton riedemann agent standard oil company along several sister ship gluckauf wa lost grounded fog standard oil purchased sister ship

marine racecar board national academy science conducted survey industry expert regarding pro con double hull design 
advantage double hull design mentioned include ease ballasting emergency situation reduced practice saltwater ballasting cargo tank decrease corrosion increased environmental protection cargo discharge quicker complete easier tank washing efficient better protection low impact collision grounding 
report list following drawback double hull design including higher build cost greater operating expense eg higher canal port tariff difficulty ballast tank ventilation fact ballast tank need continuou monitoring maintenance increased transverse free surface greater number surface maintain risk explosion double hull space vapor detection system fitted cleaning ballast tank difficult double hull ship 
double hull tanker said safer single hull grounding incident especially shore rocky safety benefit les clear larger vessel case high speed impact 
although double hull design superior low energy casualty prevent spillage small casualty high energy casualty hull breached oil spill double hull sea spill double hull tanker significantly higher design like mid deck tanker coulombi egg tanker even pre marpol tanker last one ha lower oil column reach hydrostatic balance sooner
