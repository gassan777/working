type raw natural gas well 
raw natural gas come primarily one three type well crude oil well gas well condensate well 
natural gas come crude oil well typically called associated gas 
thi gas existed gas cap crude oil underground formation could dissolved crude oil 
natural gas gas well condensate well little crude oil called non associated gas 
gas well typically produce raw natural gas condensate well produce raw natural gas along low molecular weight hydrocarbon 
liquid ambient condition ie pentane heavier called natural gas condensate sometime also called natural gasoline simply condensate 
natural gas called sweet gas relatively free hydrogen sulfide gas contain hydrogen sulfide called smy gas 
natural gas gas mixture containing significant quantity hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide similar acidic gase called acid gas 
raw natural gas also come methane deposit pore coal seam especially concentrated state adsorption onto surface coal

coalbed gas ha become important source energy recent decade 
contaminant raw natural gas 
raw natural gas typically consist primarily methane ch shortest lightest hydrocarbon molecule 
also contain varying amount heavier gaseou hydrocarbon ethane ch propane ch normal butane ch isobutane ch pentane even higher molecular weight hydrocarbon 
processed purified finished product collectively referred natural gas liquid ngl 
acid gase carbon dioxide co hydrogen sulfide mercaptan methanethiol chsh ethanethiol chsh 
gase nitrogen helium 
water water vapor liquid water 
also dissolved salt dissolved gase acid 
liquid hydrocarbon perhap natural gas condensate also referred casinghead gasoline natural gasoline andor crude oil 
mercury small amount mercury primarily elemental form chloride species possibly present naturally occurring radioactive material norm natural gas may contain radon produced water may contain dissolved trace radium accumulate within piping processing equipmentcitation needed thi render piping equipment radioactive time 
raw natural gas must purified meet quality standard specified major pipeline transmission distribution company 
quality standard vary pipeline pipeline usually function pipeline system design market serve 
general standard specify natural gas within specific range heating value caloric value 
example united state btu per cubic foot gas atmosphere mj per cubic metre gas atmosphere 
delivered specified hydrocarbon dew point temperature hydrocarbon gas might condense pipeline pressure forming liquid slug could damage pipeline 
dew point adjustment serve reduction concentration water heavy hydrocarbon natural gas extent condensation occur ensuing transport pipeline free particulate solid liquid water prevent erosion corrosion damage pipeline 
dehydrated water vapor sufficiently prevent formation methane hydrate within gas processing plant subsequently within sale gas transmission pipeline 
typical water content specification gas must contain seven pound water per million standard cubic foot mmscf gas contain trace amount component hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide mercaptan nitrogen 
common specification hydrogen sulfide content grain per cubic foot gas approximately ppm 
specification co typically limit content two three percent 
maintain mercury les detectable limit approximately ppb volume primarily avoid damaging equipment gas processing plant pipeline transmission system mercury amalgamation embrittlement aluminum metal
