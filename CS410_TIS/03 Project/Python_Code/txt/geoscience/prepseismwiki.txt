history 
seismic testing 
reflection refraction seismic wave geologic interface within earth first observed recording earthquake generated seismic wave 
basic model earth deep interior based observation earthquake generated seismic wave transmitted earth interior eg mohorovicic use human generated seismic wave map detail geology upper kilometer earth crust followed shortly thereafter ha developed mainly due commercial enterprise particularly petroleum industry 
seismic reflection exploration grew seismic refraction exploration method wa used find oil associated salt dome ludger mintrop german mine surveyor devised mechanical seismograph successfully used detect salt dome germany 
applied german patent wa issued 
founded company seismo wa hired conduct seismic exploration texa mexico resulting first commercial discovery oil using refraction seismic method discovery orchard salt dome texa led boom seismic refraction exploration along gulf coast method led discovery shallow gulf coast salt dome refraction seismic method faded 
canadian inventor reginald fessenden wa first conceive using reflected seismic wave infer geology 
hi work wa initially propagation acoustic wave water motivated sinking titanic iceberg 
also worked method detecting submarine world war applied first patent seismic exploration method wa issued 
due war wa unable follow idea 
john clarence karcher discovered seismic reflection independently working united state bureau standard national institute standard technology method sound ranging detect artillery 
discussion colleague idea developed reflection could aid exploration petroleum 
several many affiliated university oklahoma karcher helped form geological engineering company incorporated oklahoma april 
first field test conducted near oklahoma city oklahoma 
early reflection seismology wa viewed skepticism many oil industry 
early advocate method commented 
one personally tried introduce method general consulting practice senior writer definitely recall many time reflection even considered par divining rod least device background tradition 
geological engineering company folded due drop price oil 
oil price rebounded karcher helped form geophysical research corporation grc part oil company amerada 
karcher left grc helped found geophysical service incorporated gsi 
gsi wa one successful seismic contracting company year wa parent even successful company texa instrument 
early gsi employee henry salvatorus left company found another major seismic contractor western geophysical 
many company using reflection seismology hydrocarbon exploration hydrology engineering study application formed since method wa first invented 
major service company today include cgg ion geophysical petroleum geo service polarcu tg westerngeco 
major oil company also actively conducted research seismic method well collected processed seismic datum using personnel technology 
reflection seismology ha also found application non commercial research academic government scientist around world 
environmental impact 
human activity seismic reflection survey may impact earth natural environment hydrocarbon industry environmental group partake research investigate effect 
land 
land conducting seismic survey may require building road transporting equipment personnel vegetation may need cleared deployment equipment 
survey relatively undeveloped area significant habitat disturbance may occur many government require seismic company follow strict rule regarding destruction environment example use dynamite seismic source may disallowed 
seismic processing technique allow seismic line deviate around natural obstacle use pre existing non straight track trail 
careful planning thi greatly reduce environmental impact land seismic survey 
recent use inertial navigation instrument land survey instead theodolite decreased impact seismic allowing winding survey line tree 
marine 
main environmental concern marine seismic survey potential noise associated high energy seismic source disturb injure animal life especially cetacean whale porpoise dolphin mammal use sound primary method communication one another high level long duration sound cause physical damage hearing los wherea lower level noise cause temporary threshold shift hearing obscuring sound vital marine life behavioural disturbance 
study ha shown migrating humpback whale leave minimum km gap themself operating seismic vessel resting humpback whale pod cow exhibiting increased sensitivity leaving increased gap km 
conversely study found male humpback whale attracted single operating airgun believed confused low frequency sound whale breaching behavimy 
addition whale sea turtle fish squid showed alarm avoidance behavimy presence approaching seismic source 
difficult compare report effect seismic survey noise marine life method unit often inadequately documented 
gray whale avoid regular migratory feeding ground km area seismic testingcitation needed similarly breathing gray whale wa shown rapid indicating discomfort panic whale 
circumstantial evidence thi ha led researcher believe avoidance panic might responsible increased whale beaching although research ongoing question 
offering another point view joint paper international association geophysical contractor iagc international association oil gas producer ogp argue noise created marine seismic survey comparable natural source seismic noise stating 
sound produced seismic survey comparable magnitude many naturally occurring man made sound source 
furthermore specific characteristic seismic sound operational procedure employed seismic survey resulting risk marine mammal expected exceptionally low 
fact three decade world wide seismic surveying activity variety research project shown evidence would suggest sound ep seismic activity ha resulted physical auditory injury marine mammal species
