dating method 
relative dating 
main article relative dating cros cutting relation used determine relative age rock stratum geological structure 
explanation folded rock stratum cut thrust fault large intrusion cutting erosional angular unconformity cutting rock stratum deposited volcanic dyke cutting even younger rock stratum overlying normal fault cutting 
method relative dating developed geology first emerged natural science 
geologist still use following principle today mean provide information geologic history timing geologic event 
principle uniformitarianism state geologic process observed operation modify earth crust present worked much way geologic time fundamental principle geology advanced th century scottish physician geologist jame hutton present key past 
hutton word past history globe must explained seen happening 
principle intrusive relationship concern crosscutting intrusion 
geology igneou intrusion cut acros formation sedimentary rock determined igneou intrusion younger sedimentary rock 
different type intrusion include stock laccolith batholith sill dike 
principle cros cutting relationship pertain formation fault age sequence cut 
fault younger rock cut accordingly fault found penetrate formation top formation cut older fault one cut must younger fault 
finding key bed situation may help determine whether fault normal fault thrust fault 
principle inclusion component state sedimentary rock inclusion clast found formation inclusion must older formation contain 
example sedimentary rock common gravel older formation ripped included newer layer 
similar situation igneou rock occur xenolith found 
foreign body picked magma lava flow incorporated later cool matrix 
result xenolith older rock contain

principle original horizontality state deposition sediment occur essentially horizontal bed 
observation modern marine non marine sediment wide variety environment support thi generalization although cros bedding inclined overall orientation cros bedded unit horizontal 
principle superposition state sedimentary rock layer tectonically undisturbed sequence younger one beneath older one 
logically younger layer cannot slip beneath layer previously deposited 
thi principle allows sedimentary layer viewed form vertical time line partial complete record time elapsed deposition lowest layer deposition highest bed 
principle faunal succession based appearance fossil sedimentary rock 
organism exist time period throughout world presence sometime absence may used provide relative age formation found 
based principle laid william smith almost hundred year publication charle darwin theory evolution principle succession developed independently evolutionary thought 
principle become quite complex however given uncertainty fossilization localization fossil type due lateral change habitat facy change sedimentary stratum fossil may found globally time

main article absolute dating radiometric dating geochronology 
geologist also use method determine absolute age rock sample geological event 
date useful may also used conjunction relative dating method calibrate relative method 
beginning th century advancement geological science wa facilitated ability obtain accurate absolute date geologic event using radioactive isotope method 
thi changed understanding geologic time 
previously geologist could use fossil stratigraphic correlation date section rock relative one another 
isotopic date became possible assign absolute age rock unit absolute date could applied fossil sequence wa datable material converting old relative age new absolute age 
many geologic application isotope ratio radioactive element measured mineral give amount time ha passed since rock passed particular closure temperature point different radiometric isotope stop diffusing crystal lattice used geochronologic thermochronologic study

geological development area 
originally horizontal sequence sedimentary rock shade tan affected igneou activity 
deep surface magma chamber large associated igneou body 
magma chamber feed volcano send offshoot magma later crystallize dike sill 
magma also advance upward form intrusive igneou body 
diagram illustrate cinder cone volcano release ash composite volcano release lava ash 
illustration three type fault 
strike slip fault occur rock unit slide past one another normal fault occur rock undergoing horizontal extension reverse thrust fault occur rock undergoing horizontal shortening 
geology area change time rock unit deposited inserted deformational process change shape location 
rock unit first emplaced either deposition onto surface intrusion overlying rock 
deposition occur sediment settle onto surface earth later lithify sedimentary rock volcanic material volcanic ash lava flow blanket surface 
igneou intrusion batholith laccolith dike sill push upward overlying rock crystallize intrude 
initial sequence rock ha deposited rock unit deformed andor metamorphosed 
deformation typically occur result horizontal shortening horizontal extension side side strike slip motion 
structural regime broadly relate convergent boundary divergent boundary transform boundary respectively tectonic plate 
rock unit placed horizontal compression shorten become thicker 
rock unit mud significantly change volume thi accomplished two primary way faulting folding 
shallow crust brittle deformation occur thrust fault form cause deeper rock move top shallower rock 
deeper rock often older noted principle superposition thi result older rock moving top younger one 
movement along fault result folding either fault planar rock layer dragged along forming drag fold slip occur along fault 
deeper earth rock behave plastically fold instead faulting 
fold either material center fold buckle upward creating antiform buckle downward creating synform 
top rock unit within fold remain pointing upward called anticline syncline respectively 
unit fold facing downward structure called overturned anticline syncline rock unit overturned correct direction unknown simply called general term antiform synform 
diagram fold indicating anticline syncline 
even higher pressure temperature horizontal shortening cause folding metamorphism rock 
thi metamorphism cause change mineral composition rock create foliation planar surface related mineral growth stres 
thi remove sign original texture rock bedding sedimentary rock flow feature lava crystal pattern crystalline rock 
extension cause rock unit whole become longer thinner 
thi primarily accomplished normal faulting ductile stretching thinning 
normal fault drop rock unit higher lower 
thi typically result younger unit placed older unit 
stretching unit result thinning fact location within marium fold thrust belt entire sedimentary sequence grand canyon seen length les meter 
rock depth ductilely stretched often also metamorphosed 
stretched rock also pinch lense known boudin french word sausage visual similarity 
rock unit slide past one another strike slip fault develop shallow region become shear zone deeper depth rock deform ductilely 
geologic cros section kittatinny mountain 
thi cros section show metamorphic rock overlain younger sediment deposited metamorphic event 
rock unit later folded faulted uplift mountain 
addition new rock unit depositionally intrusively often occur deformation 
faulting deformational process result creation topographic gradient causing material rock unit increasing elevation eroded hillslope channel 
sediment deposited rock unit going 
continual motion along fault maintain topographic gradient spite movement sediment continue create accommodation space material deposit 
deformational event often also associated volcanism igneou activity 
volcanic ash lava accumulate surface igneou intrusion enter 
dike long planar igneou intrusion enter along crack therefore often form large number area actively deformed 
thi result emplacement dike swarm observable acros canadian shield ring dike around lava tube volcano 
process necessarily occur single environment necessarily occur single order 
hawaiian island example consist almost entirely layered basaltic lava flow 
sedimentary sequence mid continental united state grand canyon southwestern united state contain almost undeformed stack sedimentary rock remained place since cambrian time 
area much geologically complex 
southwestern united state sedimentary volcanic intrusive rock metamorphosed faulted foliated folded 
even older rock acastum gneis slave craton northwestern canada oldest known rock world metamorphosed point origin undiscernable without laboratory analysi
